BUSINESS\n\nOverview\n\nAs our founders Larry and Sergey wrote in the original founders' letter, \"Google is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one.\" That unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history, inspiring us to tackle big problems and invest in moonshots, such as our long-term opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI). We continue this work under the leadership of Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai.\n\nAlphabet  is  a  collection  of  businesses  -  the  largest  of  which  is  Google.  We  report  Google  in  two  segments, Google Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Alphabet's structure is about helping each of our businesses prosper through strong leaders and independence.\n\nAccess and technology for everyone\n\nThe Internet is one of the world's most powerful equalizers; it propels ideas, people and businesses large and small.  Our  mission  to  organize  the  world's  information  and  make  it  universally  accessible  and  useful  is  as  relevant today as it was when we were founded in 1998. Since then, we have evolved from a company that helps people find answers to a company that also helps people get things done.\n\nWe are focused on building an even more helpful Google for everyone, and we aspire to give everyone the tools they need to increase their knowledge, health, happiness, and success. Google Search helps people find information and  make  sense  of  the  world  in  more  natural  and  intuitive  ways,  with  trillions  of  searches  on  Google  every  year. YouTube provides people with entertainment, information, and opportunities to learn something new. Google Assistant offers  the  best  way  to  get  things  done  seamlessly  across  different  devices,  providing  intelligent  help  throughout  a person's day, no matter where they are. Google Cloud helps customers solve today's business challenges, improve productivity, reduce costs, and unlock new growth engines. We are continually innovating and building new products and features that will help our users, partners, customers, and communities and have invested more than $100 billion in research and development in the last five years in support of these efforts.\n\n4\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nMoonshots\n\nMany companies get  comfortable  doing  what  they  have  always  done,  making  only  incremental  changes.  This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android and when we launched Chrome, but those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer, popular browser. We continue to look toward the future and to invest for the long term within each of our segments. As we said in the original founders' letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in, as they are the key to our long-term success.\n\nThe power of AI\n\nWe  believe  that  AI  is  a  foundational  and  transformational  technology  that  will  provide  compelling  and  helpful benefits to people and society through its capacity to assist, complement, empower, and inspire people in almost every field of human endeavor. As an information and computer science company, we will continue to be at the forefront of advancing the frontier of AI. Through our path-breaking and field-defining research and development, we responsibly and boldly develop more capable and useful AI every day.\n\nAI already powers Google's core products that help billions of people every day and has been at the foundation of our  core  ads  quality  systems  for  years,  helping  large  and  small  businesses  all  over  the  world  to  produce  and  run effective and efficient ad campaigns that help grow their businesses. AI makes it possible to search in new languages, with multiple inputs, such as using images and text at the same time with the Google App. Some of our most popular products at Google - including Lens and Translate - were built entirely using artificial intelligence technologies such as optical character recognition and machine learning. Google Cloud continues to build AI into numerous solutions that our customers can use to develop AI-powered applications - including processing documents, images, and translation - to understand and analyze data more efficiently, and to use packaged solutions for a variety of industries. In all these examples, AI significantly enhances the usefulness and multiplies the value of these products and services to people and organizations.\n\nOur view is that AI is now, and more than ever, critical to delivering on our mission. As we bring our breakthrough AI  innovations  into  the  real  world  to  assist  people  and  benefit  society  everywhere,  we  are  also  pursuing  further advancements  that  will  help  to  unlock  scientific  discoveries  and  to  tackle  humanity's  greatest  challenges  and opportunities.\n\nPrivacy and security\n\nWe make it a priority to protect the privacy and security of our products, users, and customers, even if there are near-term financial consequences. We do this by continuously investing in building products that are secure by default; strictly upholding responsible data practices that emphasize privacy by design; and building easy-to-use settings that put people in control. We are continually enhancing these efforts over time, whether by enabling users to auto-delete their data, giving them new tools, such as My Ad Center, to control their ad experience, or advancing anti-malware, anti-phishing, and password security features.\n\nGoogle\n\nFor reporting purposes Google comprises two segments: Google Services and Google Cloud.\n\nGoogle Services\n\nServing our users\n\nWe have always  been  committed  to  building  helpful  products  that  can  improve  the  lives  of  millions  of  people worldwide. Our product innovations are what make our services widely used, and our brand one of the most recognized in  the  world. Google Services' core products and platforms include ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Gmail, Google Drive, Google Maps, Google Photos, Google Play, Search, and YouTube, with broad and growing adoption by users around the world.\n\nOur products and services have come a long way since the company was founded more than two decades ago. Rather than the ten blue links in our early search results, users can now get direct answers to their questions using their computer or mobile device, their own voice, a photo, or an image, making it quicker, easier, and more natural to find what they are looking for. Of the searches we see every day, 15% are new.\n\nThis drive to make information more accessible and helpful has led us over the years to improve the discovery and  creation  of  digital  content  both  on  the  web  and  through  platforms  like  Google  Play  and  YouTube.  People  are consuming many forms of digital content, including watching videos, playing games, listening to music, reading books,\n\n5\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nand using apps. Working with content creators and partners, we continue to build new ways for people around the world to find great digital content.\n\nFueling all of these great digital experiences are extraordinary platforms and hardware. That is why we continue to invest in platforms like our Android mobile operating system, Chrome browser, and Chrome operating system, as well as growing our family of hardware devices. We see tremendous potential for devices to be helpful and make people's lives easier by combining the best of our AI, software, and hardware. This potential is reflected in our latest generation of hardware products such as the new Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro, and the very first Pixel Watch. Creating products that people rely on every day is a journey that we are investing in for the long-term.\n\nHow we make money\n\nWe have built world-class advertising technologies for advertisers, agencies, and publishers to power their digital marketing businesses. Our advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses through our wide range of products across devices and formats, and we aim to ensure positive user experiences by serving the right ads at the right time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies.\n\nGoogle Services generates revenues primarily by delivering both performance and brand advertising that appears on  Google  Search  &  other  properties,  YouTube,  and  Google  Network  partners'  properties  (\"Google  Network properties\"). We continue to invest in both performance and brand advertising and seek to improve the measurability of advertising so advertisers understand the effectiveness of their campaigns.\n\nPerformance  advertising creates  and  delivers  relevant  ads  that  users  will  click  on  leading  to  direct engagement with advertisers.  Performance  advertising  lets  our  advertisers  connect  with  users  while  driving measurable results. Our ads tools allow performance advertisers to create simple text-based ads.\n\nBrand advertising helps  enhance  users'  awareness  of  and  affinity  for  advertisers'  products  and  services, through  videos,  text,  images,  and  other  interactive  ads  that  run  across  various  devices.  We  help  brand advertisers deliver digital videos and other types of ads to specific audiences for their brand-building marketing campaigns.\n\nWe have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web. We focus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways, including filtering out invalid traffic, removing billions of bad ads from our systems every year, and closely monitoring the sites, apps, and videos where ads appear and blocklisting them when necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content.\n\nWe  continue  to  focus  on  growing  revenues  beyond  advertising,  from  Google  Play,  hardware,  and  YouTube subscriptions, such as:\n\nGoogle Play generates revenues from sales of apps and in-app purchases.\n\nHardware generates revenues from sales of Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, and Pixel devices.\n\nYouTube non-advertising generates  subscription  revenues  from  services  such  as  YouTube  Premium  and YouTube TV.\n\nGoogle Cloud\n\nGoogle  was  a  company  built  in  the  cloud,  and  we  continue  to  invest  in  our  Google  Cloud  offerings,  including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace. Google Cloud Platform provides leading technology in cybersecurity; data, analytics, AI, and machine learning; and infrastructure. Our cybersecurity products help customers detect, protect, and  respond  to  a  broad  range  of  cybersecurity  threats.  Our  data  cloud  unifies  data  lakes,  data  warehouses,  data governance, and advanced machine learning into a single platform that can analyze data across any cloud. We provide customers an open, reliable, and scalable infrastructure that enables them to run workloads anywhere - on our Cloud, at  the  edge,  or  in  their  data  centers.  Additionally,  Google  Workspace's  easy-to-use  and  secure  communication  and collaboration tools, which include apps like Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar, Meet, and more, enable secure hybrid work, boosting productivity and collaboration.\n\nOther Bets\n\nAcross Alphabet we are also using technology to try to solve big problems that affect a wide variety of industries from  improving  transportation  and  health  technology  to  exploring  solutions  to  address  climate  change.  Alphabet's investment in the portfolio of Other Bets includes businesses that are at various stages of development, ranging from those in the R&D phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization. Our goal is for them to become thriving, successful businesses. Other Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own\n\n6\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nboards  with  independent  members  and  outside  investors.  While  these  early-stage  businesses  naturally  come  with considerable uncertainty, some of them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their industries. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\n\nCompetition\n\nOur business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptive technologies. We face formidable competition in every aspect of our business, including, among others, from:\n\ngeneral purpose search engines and information services;\n\nvertical search engines and e-commerce providers for queries related to travel, jobs, and health, which users may navigate directly to rather than go through Google;\n\nonline advertising platforms and networks;\n\nother forms of advertising, such as billboards, magazines, newspapers, radio, and television as our advertisers typically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline;\n\ndigital content and application platform providers;\n\nproviders of enterprise cloud services;\n\ncompanies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that have developed proprietary platforms;\n\nproviders of digital video services;\n\nsocial  networks,  which  users  may  rely  on  for  product  or  service  referrals,  rather  than  seeking  information through traditional search engines;\n\nproviders of workspace communication and connectivity products; and\n\ndigital assistant providers.\n\nCompeting  successfully  depends  heavily  on  our  ability  to  develop  and  distribute  innovative  products  and technologies to the marketplace across our businesses. For example, for advertising, competing successfully depends on attracting and retaining:\n\nusers, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance of our advertising, as well as the general usefulness, security, and availability of our products and services;\n\nadvertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver their advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels; and\n\ncontent  providers,  primarily  based  on  the  quality  of  our  advertiser  base,  our  ability  to  help  these  partners generate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\n\nFor additional information about competition, see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nOngoing Commitment to Sustainability\n\nWe believe that every business has the opportunity and obligation to protect our planet. Sustainability is one of our core  values  at  Google,  and  we  strive  to  build  sustainability  into  everything  we  do.  We  have  been  a  leader  on sustainability  and  climate  change  since  Google's  founding  more  than  20  years  ago.  These  are  some  of  our  key achievements over the past two decades:\n\nIn 2007, we became the first major company to be carbon neutral for our operations.\n\nIn  2017,  we  became  the  first  major  company  to  match  100%  of  our  annual  electricity  use  with  renewable energy, which we have achieved for five consecutive years.\n\nIn 2020, we issued $5.75 billion in sustainability bonds-the largest sustainability or green bond issuance by any company in history at the time. The net proceeds from the issuance were used to fund environmentally and socially responsible projects in the following eight areas: energy efficiency, clean energy, green buildings, clean transportation, circular economy and design, affordable housing, commitment to racial equity, and support for small businesses and COVID-19 crisis response. As of 2022, we had fully allocated the net proceeds from our sustainability bonds as outlined in our Sustainability Bond Impact Report published in 2022.\n\nOur sustainability strategy is focused on three key pillars: accelerating the transition to carbon-free energy and a circular economy, empowering everyone with technology, and benefiting the people and places where we operate.\n\n7\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nTo  accelerate  the  transition  to  a  carbon-free  and  circular  economy,  in  2020,  we  launched  our  third  decade  of climate action, and we are now working toward a new set of ambitious goals. By 2030, we aim to:\n\nachieve  net-zero  emissions  across  all  of  our  operations  and  value  chain,  including  our  consumer  hardware products;\n\nbecome the first major company to run on carbon-free energy 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year;\n\nenable 5 gigawatts of new carbon-free energy through investments in our key manufacturing regions; and\n\nhelp more than 500 cities and local governments reduce an aggregate of 1 gigaton (one billion tons) of carbon emissions annually.\n\nWe also aim to maximize the reuse of finite resources across our operations, products, and supply chains and to enable others to do the same.\n\nWe are committed to helping people make more sustainable choices by empowering them with technology. We introduced eco-friendly routing in Google Maps; new features to book flights or purchase appliances that have lower carbon footprints; and when people come to Google Search with questions about climate change, we show information from authoritative sources like the United Nations.\n\nTo benefit the people and places where we operate, we have set goals to replenish more water than we consume by 2030 and to support water security in communities where we operate. We are focused on three areas: enhancing our stewardship of water resources across Google offices and data centers; replenishing our water use and improving watershed health and ecosystems in water-stressed communities; and sharing technology and tools that help everyone predict, prevent, and recover from water stress. At Google we remain steadfast in our commitment to sustainability, and we will continue to lead and encourage others to join us in improving the health of our planet. We are proud of what we have achieved so far, and we are energized to help move the world closer to a more sustainable and carbon-free future for all.\n\nMore information  on  our  approach  to  sustainability  can  be  found  in  our  annual  sustainability  reports,  including Google's Environmental Report. The contents of our sustainability reports are not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC. For additional information about risks and uncertainties applicable to our commitments to attain certain sustainability goals, see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nCulture and Workforce\n\nWe are a company of curious, talented, and passionate people. We embrace collaboration and creativity, and encourage the iteration of ideas to address complex challenges in technology and society.\n\nOur people are critical for our continued success, so we work hard to create an environment where employees can have fulfilling careers, and be happy, healthy, and productive. We offer industry-leading benefits and programs to take  care  of  the  diverse  needs  of  our  employees  and  their  families,  including  opportunities  for  career  growth  and development, resources to support their financial health, and access to excellent healthcare choices. Our competitive compensation programs help us to attract and retain top candidates, and we will continue to invest in recruiting talented people to technical and non-technical roles, and rewarding them well. We provide a variety of high quality training and support to managers to build and strengthen their capabilities--ranging from courses for new managers, to learning resources that help them provide feedback and manage performance, to coaching and individual support.\n\nAt Alphabet we are committed to making diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do and to growing a workforce  that  is  representative  of  the  users  we  serve.  More  information  on  Google's  approach  to  diversity  can  be found in our annual diversity reports, available publicly at diversity.google. The contents of our diversity reports are not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC.\n\nAs of  December 31, 2022, Alphabet had 190,234 employees. We have work councils and statutory employee representation obligations in certain countries, and we are committed to supporting protected labor rights, maintaining an open culture, and listening to all employees. Supporting healthy and open dialogue is central to how we work, and we communicate information about the company through multiple internal channels to our employees.\n\nWhen necessary we contract with businesses around the world to provide specialized services where we do not have appropriate in-house expertise or resources, often in fields that require specialized training like cafe operations, content moderation, customer support, and physical security. We also contract with temporary staffing agencies when we need to cover short-term leaves, when we have spikes in business needs, or when we need to quickly incubate\n\n8\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nspecial projects. We choose our partners and staffing agencies carefully, and review their compliance with Google's Supplier  Code  of  Conduct.  We  continually  make  improvements  to  promote  a  respectful  and  positive  working environment for everyone - employees, vendors, and temporary staff alike.\n\nGovernment Regulation\n\nWe are subject to numerous United States (U.S.) federal, state, and local, as well as foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subjects. Like other companies in the technology industry, we face heightened scrutiny from both U.S. and foreign governments with respect to our compliance with laws and regulations. Many of these laws and regulations are evolving and their applicability and scope, as interpreted by the courts, remain uncertain. Particularly with regard to data privacy and security; content moderation; competition; consumer protection; climate change and sustainability; and reporting on human capital and diversity, we have seen an increase in new and evolving laws and regulations,  as  well  as  related  enforcement  actions,  being  proposed  and  implemented  in  recent  years  by  legislative bodies around the world.\n\nOur  compliance  with  these  laws  and  regulations  may  be  onerous  and  could,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate, increase  our  cost  of  doing  business,  make  our  products  and  services  less  useful,  limit  our  ability  to  pursue  certain business  models,  cause  us  to  change  our  business  practices,  affect  our  competitive  position  relative  to  our  peers, and/or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nFor additional information about government regulation applicable to our business, see Risk Factors in Item 1A; Trends  in  Our  Business  and  Financial  Effect  in  Part  II,  Item  7;  and  Legal  Matters  in  Note  10  of  the  Notes  to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nIntellectual Property\n\nWe rely on various intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We have registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks,  service  marks,  domain  names,  and  copyrights.  We  have  also  filed  patent  applications  in  the  U.S.  and foreign countries covering certain of our technology, and acquired patent assets to supplement our portfolio. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our rights to other parties. For additional information, see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nAvailable Information\n\nOur  website  is  located  at  www.abc.xyz,  and  our  investor  relations  website  is  located  at  www.abc.xyz/investor.

RISK FACTORS\n\nOur  operations  and  financial  results  are  subject  to  various  risks  and  uncertainties,  including  but  not  limited  to those described below, which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results, and affect the trading price of our Class A and Class C stock.\n\nRisks Specific to our Company\n\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising. Reduced spending by advertisers, a loss of partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to customize ads could harm our business.\n\nWe  generated  more  than  80%  of  total  revenues  from  online  advertising  in  2022.  Many  of  our  advertisers, companies  that  distribute  our  products  and  services,  digital  publishers,  and  content  providers  can  terminate  their contracts with us at any time. These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value\n\n9\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\n(such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more effective monetization) than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practices, as well as changes to other companies' advertising and/or data privacy practices have in the past, and may in the future, affect the advertising that we are able to provide. In addition, technologies have been developed that make customized ads more difficult or that block the display of ads altogether, and some providers of online services have integrated these technologies  that  could  potentially  impair  the  availability  and  functionality  of  third-party  digital  advertising.  Failing  to provide  superior  value  or  deliver  advertisements  effectively  and  competitively  could  harm  our  business,  reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions. Adverse macroeconomic  conditions  have  affected,  and  may  in  the  future  affect,  the  demand  for  advertising,  resulting  in fluctuations  in  the  amounts  our  advertisers  spend  on  advertising,  which  could  harm  our  financial  condition  and operating results.\n\nWe face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful  to  users,  customers,  and  other  partners,  we  may  not  remain  competitive,  which  could  harm  our business, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nOur  business  environment  is  rapidly  evolving  and  intensely  competitive.  Our  businesses  face  changing technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of rival products and services. To compete successfully, we must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant and useful products, services, and technologies in a timely manner. As our businesses evolve, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider  range  of  products  and  services.  We  must  continue  to  invest  significant  resources  in  R&D,  including  through acquisitions, in order to enhance our technology and new and existing products and services.\n\nWe  have  many  competitors  in  different  industries.  Our  current  and  potential  domestic  and  international competitors  range  from  large  and  established  companies  to  emerging  start-ups.  Some  competitors  have  longer operating histories and well established relationships in various sectors. They can use their experience and resources in ways that could affect our competitive position, including by making acquisitions, continuing to invest heavily in R&D and  in  talent,  initiating  intellectual  property  and  competition  claims  (whether  or  not  meritorious),  and  continuing  to compete for users, advertisers,  customers,  and  content  providers.  Further,  discrepancies  in  enforcement  of  existing laws may enable our lesser known competitors to aggressively interpret those laws without commensurate scrutiny, thereby affording them competitive advantages. Our competitors may also be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can or may foresee the need for products and services before us.\n\nOur financial condition and operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive to the evolving  needs  and  desires  of  our  users,  advertisers,  publishers,  customers,  and  content  providers.  As  new  and existing technologies continue to develop, competitors and new entrants may be able to offer experiences that are, or that are seen to be, substantially similar to or better than ours. These technologies could reduce usage of our products and services, and force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources to develop and operate equal or better products and services. Competitors' success in providing compelling products and services or in attracting and retaining  users,  advertisers,  publishers,  customers,  and  content  providers  could  harm  our  financial  condition  and operating results.\n\nOur ongoing investment in new businesses, products, services, and technologies is inherently risky, and could divert management attention and harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services, and technologies. The investments  that  we  are  making  across  our  businesses,  such  as  in  AI,  reflect  our  ongoing  efforts  to  innovate  and provide products and services that are useful to users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. Our investments  span  a  wide  range  of  industries  beyond  online  advertising.  Such  investments  ultimately  may  not  be commercially viable or may not result in an adequate return of capital and, in pursuing new strategies, we may incur unanticipated  liabilities.  These  endeavors  may  involve  significant  risks  and  uncertainties,  including  diversion  of resources and management attention from current operations and the use of alternative investment, governance, or compensation structures that may fail to adequately align incentives across the company or otherwise accomplish their objectives.\n\nWithin Google Services, we continue to invest heavily in hardware, including our smartphones, home devices, and wearables, which is a highly competitive market with frequent introduction of new products and services, rapid adoption of  technological  advancements  by  competitors,  short  product  life  cycles,  evolving  industry  standards,  continual improvement  in  performance  characteristics,  and  price  and  feature  sensitivity  on  the  part  of  consumers  and businesses. There can be no assurance we will be able to provide hardware that competes effectively.\n\n10\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nWithin Google Cloud, we devote significant resources to develop and deploy our enterprise-ready cloud services, including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace. We are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services, invest in cybersecurity, and hire talent, particularly to support and scale our sales force.  At  the  same  time,  our  competitors  are  rapidly  developing  and  deploying  cloud-based  services.  Pricing  and delivery  models  are  competitive  and  constantly  evolving,  and  we  may  not  attain  sufficient  scale  and  profitability  to achieve  our  business  objectives.  Further,  our  business  with  public  sector  customers  may  present  additional  risks, including regulatory compliance risks. For instance, we may be subject to government audits and cost reviews, and any failure to comply or any deficiencies found may expose us to legal, financial, and/or reputational risks. Evolving laws and regulations  may require  us  to  make  new  capital  investments,  build  new  products,  and  seek  partners  to  deliver localized services in other countries, and we may not be able to meet sovereign operating requirements.\n\nWithin Other Bets, we are investing significantly in the areas of health, life sciences, and transportation, among others. These investment areas face intense competition from large, experienced, and well-funded competitors, and our offerings, many of which involve the development of new and emerging technologies, may not be successful, or be able to compete effectively or operate at sufficient levels of profitability.\n\nIn  addition,  new and evolving products and services, including those that use AI, require significant investment and raise ethical, technological, legal, regulatory, and other challenges, which may negatively affect our brands and demand for our products and services. Because all of these investment areas are inherently risky, no assurance can be given  that  such  strategies  and  offerings  will  be  successful  or  will  not  harm  our  reputation,  financial  condition,  and operating results.\n\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time, and we anticipate downward pressure on our operating margin in the future.\n\nOur revenue growth rate could decline  over  time  as  a  result  of  a  number  of  factors,  including  changes  in  the devices and modalities used to access our products and services; changes in geographic mix; deceleration or declines in  advertiser  spending;  competition;  customer  usage  and  demand  for  our  products;  decreases  in  our  pricing  of  our products and services; ongoing product and policy changes; and shifts to lower priced products and services.\n\nIn  addition,  we  may  also  experience  downward  pressure  on  our  operating  margin  resulting  from  a  variety  of factors,  such  as  the  continued  expansion  of  our  business  into  new  fields,  including  products  and  services  such  as hardware, Google Cloud, and subscription products, as well as significant investments in Other Bets, all of which may have margins lower than those we generate from advertising. In particular, margins on our hardware products have had, and may continue to have, an adverse affect on our consolidated margins due to pressures on pricing and higher cost  of  sales.  We  may  also  experience  downward  pressure  on  our  operating  margins  from  increasing  regulations, increasing  competition,  and  increasing  costs  for  many  aspects  of  our  business.  Further,  certain  of  our  costs  and expenses are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. Additionally, in conjunction with our efforts to re-engineer costs, we may not be able to execute these efforts in a timely manner or these efforts may not be successful. Due to these factors and the evolving nature of our business, our historical revenue growth rate and historical operating margin may not be indicative of our future performance. For additional information, see Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect and Revenues and Monetization Metrics in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services, and brands as well as affect our ability to compete.\n\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, services, and technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in  which our products and services are distributed or made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Moreover, we may not have adequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. There is always the possibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable.\n\nWe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy of such trade secrets and other sensitive information could be compromised, which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets. We also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word 'Google' could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word 'search.' Some courts have ruled that \"Google\" is a protectable trademark, but it is possible that other courts, particularly those outside of the U.S.,\n\n11\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nmay reach a different determination. If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in other people using the word 'Google' to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our brand.\n\nAny significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our financial condition and operating results.\n\nOur business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our ability to expand our base of users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners.\n\nOur strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the brands within Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch new and innovative products and services that better serve the needs of our users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners. Our brands have been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by a number of factors,  including,  among  others,  reputational  issues,  third-party  content  shared  on  our  platforms,  data  privacy  and security issues and developments, and product or technical performance failures. For example, if we fail to respond appropriately to the sharing of misinformation or objectionable content on our services and/or products or objectionable practices  by  advertisers,  or  otherwise  to  adequately  address  user  concerns,  our  users  may  lose  confidence  in  our brands.\n\nFurthermore, failure to maintain and enhance our brands could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Our success will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality, trustworthy, innovative products and services that are truly useful and play a valuable role in a range of settings.\n\nWe  face  a  number  of  manufacturing  and  supply  chain  risks  that  could  harm  our  business,  financial condition, and operating results.\n\nWe face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management, which could affect our ability to supply both our products and our services.\n\nWe  rely  on  contract  manufacturers  to  manufacture  or  assemble  our  hardware  products  and  servers  and networking  equipment  used  in  our  technical  infrastructure,  and  we  may  supply  the  contract  manufacturers  with components to assemble the hardware products and equipment. We also rely on other companies to participate in the distribution of our products and services. Our business could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage these companies with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage fail to meet their obligations  (whether  due  to  financial  difficulties  or  other  reasons),  or  make  adverse  changes  in  the  pricing  or  other material terms of our arrangements with them.\n\nWe have experienced and/or may in the future experience supply shortages, price increases, and/or longer lead times  that  could  negatively  affect  our  operations,  driven  by  raw  material,  component  availability,  manufacturing capacity,  labor  shortages,  industry  allocations,  logistics  capacity,  inflation,  foreign  currency  exchange  rates,  tariffs, sanctions and export controls, trade disputes and barriers, geopolitical tensions, armed conflicts, natural disasters or pandemics, the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air  quality  effects  and  power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention, and increased storm severity), power loss, and significant changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers. In addition, some of the components we use in our technical infrastructure and our hardware products are available from only one or limited sources, and we may not be able to find replacement vendors on favorable terms in the event of a supply chain disruption. A significant supply interruption that affects us or our vendors could delay critical data center upgrades or expansions and delay consumer product availability.\n\nWe  may  enter  into  long-term  contracts  for  materials  and  products  that  commit  us  to  significant  terms  and conditions. We may face costs for materials and products that are not consumed due to market demand, technological change, changed consumer preferences, quality, product recalls, and warranty issues. For instance, because certain of our hardware supply contracts have volume-based pricing or minimum purchase requirements, if the volume of our hardware sales decreases or does not reach projected targets, we could face increased materials and manufacturing costs  or  other  financial  liabilities  that  could  make  our  products  more  costly  per  unit  to  manufacture  and  harm  our financial  condition  and  operating  results.  Furthermore,  certain  of  our  competitors  may  negotiate  more  favorable contractual terms based on volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may affect our supply.\n\nOur  products  and  services  have  had,  and  in  the  future  may  have,  quality  issues  resulting  from  design, manufacturing, or operations. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other\n\n12\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nmanufacturers or suppliers. If the quality of our products and services does not meet expectations or our products or services are defective, it could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nWe require our suppliers and business partners to comply with laws and, where applicable, our company policies and practices, such as the Google Supplier Code of Conduct, regarding workplace and employment practices, data security, environmental compliance, and intellectual property licensing, but we do not control them or their practices. Violations of law or unethical business practices could result in supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, harm to key relationships, and damage to our reputation. Their failure to procure necessary license rights to intellectual property could affect our ability to sell our products or services and expose us to litigation or financial claims.\n\nInterruption to, interference with, or failure of our complex information technology and communications systems  could  hurt  our  ability  to  effectively  provide  our  products  and  services,  which  could  harm  our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nThe availability of our products and services and fulfillment of our customer contracts depend on the continuing operation  of  our  information  technology  and  communications  systems.  Our  systems  are  vulnerable  to  damage, interference, or interruption from modifications or upgrades, terrorist attacks, state-sponsored attacks, natural disasters or pandemics, geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts, the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention, and increased storm severity), power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, software bugs, ransomware attacks, computer denial of service attacks, phishing schemes, or other attempts to harm or access our systems. Some of  our  data  centers  are  located  in  areas  with  a  high  risk  of  major  earthquakes  or  other  natural  disasters.  Our  data centers are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism, and, in some cases, to potential disruptions resulting from problems experienced by facility operators or disruptions as a result of geopolitical tensions and  conflicts  happening  in  the  area.  Some  of  our  systems  are  not  fully  redundant,  and  disaster  recovery  planning cannot account for all eventualities. The occurrence of a natural disaster or pandemic, closure of a facility, or other unanticipated problems affecting our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, our products and services are highly technical and complex and have contained in the past, and may contain in the future, errors  or  vulnerabilities,  which  could  result  in  interruptions  in  or  failure  of  our  services  or  systems.  Any  of  these incidents could impede or prevent us from effectively offering products and providing services, which could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nOur  international  operations  expose  us  to  additional  risks  that  could  harm  our  business,  financial condition, and operating results.\n\nOur international  operations  are  significant  to  our  revenues  and  net  income,  and  we  plan  to  continue  to  grow internationally.  International  revenues  accounted  for  approximately  51%  of  our  consolidated  revenues  in  2022.  In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international operations expose us to other risks, including the following:\n\nrestrictions on foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.;\n\nimport and export requirements, tariffs, and other market access barriers that may prevent or impede us from offering products or providing services to a particular market, or that could limit our ability to source assemblies and finished products from a particular market, and may increase our operating costs;\n\nlonger payment cycles in some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels of payment fraud;\n\nan  evolving  foreign  policy  landscape  that  may  adversely  affect  our  revenues  and  could  subject  us  to  new regulatory costs and challenges (including new customer requirements), in addition to other adverse effects that we are unable to effectively anticipate;\n\nsanctions,  export  controls,  and  trade  restrictions  that  limit  our  ability  to  operate  in  certain  jurisdictions  or  to comply with local laws, including as a result of geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine;\n\npolitical unrest, conflict, and changes in governmental regimes that may adversely affect demand and usage of our products and services, may limit the ability for people in certain areas to access and use our products and services, or may impede us from offering products or providing services to a particular market;\n\nanti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting certain payments to government officials, violations of which could result in civil and criminal penalties;\n\n13\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nuncertainty regarding regulatory outcomes and other liabilities, including uncertainty as a result of local laws, insufficient due process, and lack of legal precedent; and\n\ndifferent employee/employer relationships, existence of works councils and labor unions, and other challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences, making it harder to do business in certain jurisdictions.\n\nBecause we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, we have faced, and will continue to face, exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Although we hedge a portion of  our  international  currency  exposure,  significant  fluctuations  in  exchange  rates  between  the  U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenues and earnings. Hedging programs are also inherently risky and could expose us to additional risks that could harm our financial condition and operating results.\n\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in the fair values of our investments and, in some instances, our financial statements  incorporate  valuation  methodologies  that  are  subjective  in  nature  resulting  in  fluctuations  over time.\n\nThe fair value of our investments may in the future be, and certain investments have been in the past, negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, performance and financial results of the underlying entities, foreign exchange  rates,  changes  in  interest  rates,  including  changes  that  may  result  from  the  implementation  of  new benchmark rates, the effect of new or changing regulations, the stock market in general, or other factors.\n\nWe measure certain of our non-marketable equity and debt securities, certain other instruments including stockbased compensation awards settled in the stock of certain Other Bets, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The determination of fair value involves use of appropriate valuation methods and certain unobservable inputs, requires management judgment and estimation, and may change over time. We adjust the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities to fair value for observable transactions of identical or similar investments of the same issuer or for impairments. All gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities, are recognized in other income (expense), which increases the volatility of our other income (expense). The unrealized gains and losses we record from fair value remeasurements of our non-marketable equity securities in any particular period may differ significantly from the gains or losses we ultimately realize on such investments.\n\nAs a result of these factors, the value of our investments could decline, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.\n\nRisks Related to our Industry\n\nPeople access the Internet through a variety of platforms and devices that continue to evolve with the advancement of technology and user preferences. If manufacturers and users do not widely adopt versions of our products and services developed for these interfaces, our business could be harmed.\n\nPeople  access  the  Internet  through  a  growing  variety  of  devices  such  as  desktop  computers,  mobile  phones, smartphones,  laptops  and  tablets,  video  game  consoles,  voice-activated  speakers,  wearables,  automobiles,  and television-streaming devices. Our products and services may be less popular on some interfaces. Each manufacturer or  distributor  may  establish  unique  technical  standards  for  its  devices,  and  our  products  and  services  may  not  be available or may only be available with limited functionality for our users or our advertisers on these devices as a result. Some manufacturers may also elect not to include our products on their devices. In addition, search queries may be undertaken via voice-activated search, apps, social media or other platforms, which could harm our business. It is hard to  predict  the  challenges  we may encounter in adapting our products and services and developing competitive new products and services. We expect to continue to devote significant resources to creating and supporting products and services  across  multiple  platforms  and  devices.  Failing  to  attract  and  retain  a  substantial  number  of  new  device manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, developers, and users, or failing to develop products and technologies that work well on new devices and platforms, could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results and ability to capture future business opportunities.\n\nData  privacy  and  security  concerns  relating  to  our  technology  and  our  practices  could  harm  our reputation,  cause  us  to  incur  significant  liability,  and  deter  current  and  potential  users  or  customers  from using our products and services. Computer viruses, software bugs or defects, security breaches, and attacks on our systems could result in the improper disclosure and use of user data and interference with our users' and customers' ability to use our products and services, harming our business and reputation.\n\nConcerns  about,  including  the  adequacy  of,  our  practices  with  regard  to  the  collection,  use,  governance, disclosure,  or  security  of  personal  data  or  other  data-privacy-related  matters,  even  if  unfounded,  could  harm  our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Our policies and practices may change over time as expectations and regulations regarding privacy and data change.\n\n14\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nOur  products  and  services  involve  the  storage,  handling,  and  transmission  of  proprietary  and  other  sensitive information. Software bugs, theft, misuse, defects, vulnerabilities in our products and services, and security breaches expose us to a risk of loss or improper use and disclosure of such information, which could result in litigation and other potential  liabilities,  including  regulatory  fines  and  penalties,  as  well  as  reputational  harm.  Additionally,  our  products incorporate highly technical and complex technologies, and thus our technologies and software have contained, and are likely in the future to contain, undetected errors, bugs, and/or vulnerabilities. We have in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, some errors in our software code only after we have released the code. Systems and control failures, security breaches, failure to comply with our privacy policies, and/or inadvertent disclosure of user data could result in government and legal exposure, seriously harm our reputation, brand, and business, and impair our ability to attract and retain users or customers. Such incidents have occurred in the past and may continue to occur due to the scale and nature of our products and services. While there is no guarantee that such incidents will not cause significant damage, we expect to continue to expend significant resources to maintain security protections that limit the effect of bugs, theft, misuse, and security vulnerabilities or breaches.\n\nWe experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular basis. Cyber attacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. We have seen, and will continue to see, industry-wide software supply chain vulnerabilities, such as the Log4j vulnerability reported in December 2021, which could affect our or other parties' systems. We expect to continue to experience such incidents or vulnerabilities in the future. Our efforts to address undesirable activity on our platform may also increase the risk of retaliatory attack. In addition, we face the risk of cyber attacks by nation-states and statesponsored actors. These attacks may target us or our customers, particularly our public sector customers (including federal, state, and local governments). Geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, may increase these risks.\n\nWe may experience security issues, whether due to employee or insider error or malfeasance, system errors, or vulnerabilities in our or other parties' systems. While we may not determine some of these issues to be material at the time  they  occur  and  may  remedy  them  quickly,  there  is  no  guarantee  that  these  issues  will  not  ultimately  result  in significant legal, financial, and reputational harm, including government inquiries, enforcement actions, litigation, and negative publicity. There is also no guarantee that a series of issues may not be determined to be material at a later date  in  the  aggregate,  even  if  they  may  not  be  material  individually  at  the  time  of  their  occurrence.  Because  the techniques  used  to  obtain  unauthorized  access  to,  disable  or  degrade  service  provided  by  or  otherwise  sabotage systems  change  frequently  and  often  are  recognized  only  after  being  launched  against  a  target,  even  taking  all reasonable precautions, including those required by law, we have been unable in the past and may continue to be unable to anticipate or detect attacks or vulnerabilities or implement adequate preventative measures.\n\nFurther, if any partners with whom we share user or other customer information fail to implement adequate datasecurity practices, fail to comply with our terms and policies, or otherwise suffer a network or other security breach, our users' data may be improperly accessed, used, or disclosed. If an actual or perceived breach of our or our business partners'  or  service  providers'  security  occurs,  the  market  perception  of  the  effectiveness  of  our  security  measures would be harmed, we could lose users and customers, our trade secrets or those of our business partners may be compromised, and we may be exposed to significant legal and financial risks, including legal claims (which may include class-action litigation) and regulatory actions, fines, and penalties. Any of the foregoing consequences could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nWhile we have dedicated significant resources to privacy and security incident response capabilities, including dedicated worldwide incident response teams, our response process, particularly during times of a natural disaster or pandemic, may not be adequate, may fail to accurately assess the severity of an incident, may not be fast enough to prevent  or  limit  harm,  or  may  fail  to  sufficiently  remediate  an  incident.  As  a  result,  we  may  suffer  significant  legal, reputational, or financial exposure, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nFor additional information, see also our risk factor on privacy and data protection regulations under 'Risks Related to Laws, Regulations, and Policies' below.\n\nOur ongoing investments in safety, security, and content review will likely continue to identify abuse of our platforms and misuse of user data.\n\nIn addition to our efforts to prevent and mitigate cyber attacks, we are making significant investments in safety, security, and review efforts to combat misuse of our services and unauthorized access to user data by third parties, including investigation and review of platform applications that could access the information of users of our services. As a  result  of  these  efforts,  we  have  in  the  past  discovered,  and  may  in  the  future  discover,  incidents  of  unnecessary access to or misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties. However, we may not have discovered, and may in the future not discover, all such incidents or activity, whether as a result of our data limitations, including\n\n15\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nour lack of visibility over our encrypted services, the scale of activity on our platform, or other factors, including factors outside of our control such as a natural disaster or pandemic, and we may learn of such incidents or activity via third parties. Such incidents and activities may include the use of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our terms,  contracts  or  policies,  the  existence  of  false  or  undesirable  user  accounts,  election  interference,  improper  ad purchases,  activities  that  threaten  people's  safety  on-  or  off-line,  or  instances  of  spamming,  scraping,  or  spreading disinformation. While we may not determine some of these incidents to be material at the time they occurred and we may remedy them quickly, there is no guarantee that these issues will not ultimately result in significant legal, financial, and reputational harm, including government inquiries and enforcement actions, litigation, and negative publicity. There is also no guarantee that a series of issues may not be determined to be material at a later date in the aggregate, even if they may not be material individually at the time of their occurrence.\n\nWe may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise prevent or remediate any such incidents. Any of the foregoing developments may negatively affect user trust and engagement, harm our reputation and brands, require us to change our business practices in ways that harm our business operations, and adversely affect  our  business  and  financial  results.  Any  such  developments  may  also  subject  us  to  additional  litigation  and regulatory inquiries, which could result in monetary penalties and damages, divert management's time and attention, and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight.\n\nProblematic content on our platforms, including low-quality user-generated content, web spam, content farms, and other violations of our guidelines could affect the quality of our services, which could harm our reputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and services.\n\nWe,  like  others  in  the  industry,  face  violations  of  our  content  guidelines  across  our  platforms,  including sophisticated  attempts  by  bad  actors  to  manipulate  our  hosting  and  advertising  systems  to  fraudulently  generate revenues,  or  to  otherwise  generate  traffic  that  does  not  represent  genuine  user  interest  or  intent.  While  we  invest significantly in efforts to promote high-quality and relevant results and to detect and prevent low-quality content and invalid traffic, we have been unable and may continue to be unable to detect and prevent all such abuses or promote uniformly high-quality content.\n\nMany websites violate or attempt to violate our guidelines, including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher in search results than our search engine's assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them. Such efforts have affected, and may continue to affect, the quality of content on our platforms and lead them to display false, misleading, or undesirable content. Although English-language web spam in our search results has been reduced, and web spam in most other languages is limited, we expect web spammers will continue to seek inappropriate ways to improve their rankings. We continuously combat web spam in our search results, including through indexing technology that makes it harder  for  spam-like,  less  useful  web  content  to  rank  highly.  We  also  continue  to  invest  in  and  deploy  proprietary technology  to  detect  and  prevent  web  spam  on  our  platforms.  We  also  face  other  challenges  from  low-quality  and irrelevant content websites, including content farms, which are websites that generate large quantities of low-quality content  to  help  them  improve  their  search  rankings.  We  are  continually  launching  algorithmic  changes  designed  to detect  and  prevent  abuse  from  low-quality  websites.  We  also  face  other  challenges  on  our  platforms,  including violations of our content guidelines involving incidents such as attempted election interference, activities that threaten the safety and/or well-being of our users on- or off-line, and the spreading of misinformation or disinformation.\n\nIf  we  fail  to  either  detect  and  prevent  an  increase  in  problematic  content  or  effectively  promote  high-quality content,  it  could  hurt  our  reputation  for  delivering  relevant  information  or  reduce  use  of  our  platforms,  harming  our financial condition and operating results. It may also subject us to litigation and regulatory actions, which could result in monetary penalties and damages and divert management's time and attention.\n\nOur business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users. Internet access providers may be able to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers.\n\nOur products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet, and certain of our products require significant bandwidth to work effectively. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant market  power  in  the  broadband  and  internet  access  marketplace,  including  incumbent  telephone  companies,  cable companies, mobile communications companies, and government-owned service providers. Some of these providers have taken, or have stated that they may take, measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings,  by  charging  increased  fees  to  us  or  our  users  to  provide  our  offerings,  or  by  providing  our  competitors preferential access. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination by internet access providers; however, substantial uncertainty exists in the U.S. and elsewhere regarding such protections. For example, in 2018 the U.S. Federal Communications Commission repealed net neutrality rules, which could permit\n\n16\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\ninternet access providers to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services. In addition,  in  some  jurisdictions,  our  products  and  services  have  been  subject  to  government-initiated  restrictions  or blockages.  These  could  harm  existing  key  relationships,  including  with  our  users,  customers,  advertisers,  and/or content  providers,  and  impair  our  ability  to  attract  new  ones;  harm  our  reputation;  and  increase  costs,  thereby negatively affecting our business.\n\nRisks Related to Laws, Regulations, and Policies\n\nWe are subject to a variety of new, existing, and changing laws and regulations worldwide that could harm our business, and will likely be subject to an even broader scope of laws and regulations as we continue to expand our business.\n\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subjects, and our introduction of new businesses, products, services, and technologies will likely continue to subject us to additional laws and regulations. In recent years, governments around the world have proposed and adopted a large number of new laws and regulations relevant to the digital economy, particularly in the areas of data privacy and security, competition, and online content. The costs of compliance with these measures are high and are likely to increase in the future.\n\nNew or changing laws and regulations, or new interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations in a manner  inconsistent  with  our  practices,  have  resulted  in,  and  may  continue  to  result  in,  less  useful  products  and services,  altered  business  practices,  limited  ability  to  pursue  certain  business  models  or  offer  certain  products  and services, substantial costs, and civil or criminal liability. Examples include laws and regulations regarding:\n\nCompetition  and  technology  platforms'  business  practices: Laws  and  regulations  focused  on  large technology platforms, including the Digital Markets Act in the European Union (EU); regulations in South Korea and elsewhere that affect Google Play's billing policies, fees, and business model; as well as regulations under consideration in a range of jurisdictions.\n\nData privacy, collection, and processing: Laws and regulations further restricting the collection, processing, and/or sharing of user or advertising-related data, including privacy and data protection laws, laws affecting the processing of children's data (as discussed further below), data breach notification laws, and laws limiting data transfers (including data localization laws).\n\nCopyright  and  other  intellectual  property :  Copyright  and  related  laws,  including  the  EU  Directive  on Copyright in the Digital Single Market and European Economic Area transpositions, which may introduce new licensing regimes, increase liability with respect to content uploaded by users or linked to from our platforms, or create property rights in news publications that could require payments to news agencies and publishers.\n\nContent moderation :  Various  laws  covering  content  moderation  and  removal,  and  related  disclosure obligations, such as the EU's Digital Services Act, Florida's Senate Bill 7072 and Texas' House Bill 20, and laws and proposed legislation in Singapore, Australia, and the United Kingdom that impose penalties for failure to remove certain types of content or require disclosure of information about the operation of our services and algorithms, which may make it harder for services like Google Search and YouTube to detect and deal with low-quality, deceptive, or harmful content.\n\nConsumer protection :  Consumer protection laws, including the EU's New Deal for Consumers, which could result in monetary penalties and create a range of new compliance obligations.\n\nIn  addition,  the  applicability  and  scope  of  these  and  other  laws  and  regulations,  as  interpreted  by  the  courts, remain uncertain and could be interpreted in ways that harm our business. For example, we rely on statutory safe harbors, like those set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in the U.S. and the E-Commerce Directive in Europe, to protect against liability for various linking, caching, ranking, recommending, and hosting activities. Legislation or court rulings affecting these safe harbors may adversely affect us and may impose significant operational challenges. There are legislative proposals and pending litigation in the U.S. (such as Gonzalez v. Google ),  EU,  and  around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor protection for websites and online platforms.\n\nWe are and may continue to be subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, enforcement actions, consent orders, and other forms of regulatory scrutiny and legal liability that could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nWe are subject  to  claims,  lawsuits,  regulatory  and  government  investigations,  other  proceedings,  and  consent orders  involving  competition,  intellectual  property,  data  privacy  and  security,  tax  and  related  compliance,  labor  and employment,  commercial  disputes,  content  generated  by  our  users,  goods  and  services  offered  by  advertisers  or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, and other matters. We also are subject to a variety of claims including\n\n17\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nproduct warranty, product liability, and consumer protection claims related to product defects, among other litigation, and we may also be subject to claims involving health and safety, hazardous materials usage, other environmental effects, or service disruptions or failures. Claims have been brought, and we expect will continue to be brought, against us for defamation, negligence, breaches of contract, copyright and trademark infringement, unfair competition, unlawful activity,  torts,  privacy  rights  violations,  fraud,  or  other  legal  theories  based  on  the  nature  and  content  of  information available on or via our services or due to our involvement in hosting, transmitting, marketing, branding, or providing access to content created by third parties.\n\nFor example, the U.S. Department of Justice, various U.S. states, and other plaintiffs have filed several antitrust lawsuits about various aspects of our business, including our advertising technologies and practices, the operation and distribution of Google Search, and the operation and distribution of the Android operating system and Play Store. Other regulatory agencies in the U.S. and around the world, including competition enforcers, consumer protection agencies, and data protection authorities, have challenged and may continue to challenge our business practices and compliance with  laws  and  regulations.  We  are  cooperating  with  these  investigations  and  defending  litigation  where  appropriate. Various laws, regulations, investigations, enforcement lawsuits, and regulatory actions have in the past, and may in the future result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other  adverse  consequences,  all  of  which  could  harm  our  business,  reputation,  financial  condition,  and  operating results.\n\nAny of these legal proceedings could result in legal costs, diversion of management resources, negative publicity and other harms to our business. Estimating liabilities for our pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that requires significant judgment, and the amounts we are ultimately liable for may exceed our estimates. The resolution of one or more such proceedings has resulted in, and may in the future result in, additional substantial fines, penalties, injunctions, and other sanctions that could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nPrivacy, data protection, and data usage regulations are complex and rapidly evolving areas. Any failure or  alleged  failure  to  comply  with  these  laws  could  harm  our  business,  reputation,  financial  condition,  and operating results.\n\nAuthorities around the world have adopted and are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection, data usage, and encryption of user data. Adverse legal rulings, legislation, or regulation have resulted in, and may continue to result in, fines and orders requiring that we change our practices, which have had  and  could  continue  to  have  an  adverse  effect  on  how  we  provide  services,  harming  our  business,  reputation, financial condition, and operating results. These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and compliance obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs or harm the quality and operations of our products and services in ways that harm our business. Examples of these laws include:\n\nThe General Data Protection Regulation and the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulations, which apply to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or the United Kingdom, respectively, or related to products and services that we offer to EU or the United Kingdom users or customers, respectively, or the monitoring of their behavior in the EU or the UK, respectively.\n\nVarious state and foreign privacy laws and regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, the  California  Privacy  Rights  Act,  the  Virginia  Consumer  Data  Protection  Act,  the  Colorado  Privacy  Act,  the Connecticut Data Privacy Act, and the Utah Consumer Privacy Act, all of which give new data privacy rights to their respective residents (including, in California, a private right of action in the event of a data breach resulting from  our  failure  to  implement  and  maintain  reasonable  security  procedures  and  practices)  and  impose significant obligations on controllers and processors of consumer data.\n\nState laws governing the processing of biometric information, such as the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act  and  the  Texas  Capture  or  Use  of  Biometric  Identifier  Act,  which  impose  obligations  on  businesses  that collect or disclose consumer biometric information.\n\nVarious  federal,  state,  and  foreign  laws  governing  how  companies  provide  age  appropriate  experiences  to children and minors, including the collection and processing of children and minor's data. These include the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, the United Kingdom Age-Appropriate Design Code, and the California Age Appropriate Design Code, all of which address the use and disclosure of the personal data of children and minors and impose obligations on online services or products directed to or likely to be accessed by children.\n\nThe California Internet of Things Security Law, which regulates the security of data used in connection with internet-connected devices.\n\n18\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nThe EU's Digital Markets Act, which will require in-scope companies to obtain user consent for combining data across certain products and require search engines to share anonymized data with rival companies, among other changes.\n\nFurther, we are subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process and/or receive personal data. Previously available transfer mechanisms, such as the EU-U.S. and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks, were invalidated in 2020, and other bases for data transfer and storage, such as Standard Contractual Clauses, remain subject to ongoing review in ways that may require us to adapt our existing  contractual  arrangements.  The  validity  of  various  data  transfer  mechanisms  remains  subject  to  legal, regulatory, and political developments in both Europe and the U.S., including the potential adoption of the U.S.-EU Data Privacy Framework. Until the U.S.-EU Data Privacy Framework is adopted by the EU, the legal uncertainty and ongoing enforcement  action  from  supervisory  authorities  related  to  cross-border  transfers  of  personal  data,  could  harm  our ability to process and transfer personal data outside of the European Economic Area and could in turn harm our ability to provide, and our customers' ability to use, some of our products and services.\n\nWe face, and may continue to face, intellectual property and other claims that could be costly to defend, result in significant damage awards or other costs (including indemnification awards), and limit our ability to use certain technologies.\n\nWe, like other internet, technology, and media companies, are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of  infringement  or  other  violations  of  intellectual  property  rights,  including  patent,  copyright,  trade  secrets,  and trademarks. Parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in U.S. and international courts and  the  U.S.  International  Trade  Commission  (ITC)  for  exclusion  and  cease-and-desist  orders.  In  addition,  patentholding companies may frequently seek to generate income from patents they have obtained by bringing claims against us. As we continue to expand our business, the number of intellectual property claims against us has increased and may continue to increase as we develop and acquire new products, services, and technologies.\n\nAdverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements (if licenses are available at all), or orders limiting our ability to sell our products and services in the U.S. or elsewhere,  including  by  preventing  us  from  offering  certain  features,  functionalities,  products,  or  services  in  certain jurisdictions. They may also cause us to change our business practices in ways that could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business.\n\nMany of our agreements with our customers and partners, including certain suppliers, require us to defend against certain  intellectual  property  infringement  claims  and  in  some  cases  indemnify  them  for  certain  intellectual  property infringement  claims  against  them,  which  could  result  in  increased  costs  for  defending  such  claims  or  significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Such customers and partners may also discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and harm our business. Moreover, intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our suppliers, when obtainable, may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers arising from intellectual property infringement claims. Furthermore, in connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to provide  indemnification  for  certain  potential  liabilities,  including  those  associated  with  intellectual  property  claims. Regardless of their merits, intellectual property claims are often time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle. To the  extent  such  claims  are  successful,  they  could  harm  our  business,  including  our  product  and  service  offerings, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nExpectations relating to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations could expose us to potential liabilities, increased costs, and reputational harm.\n\nWe are  subject  to  laws,  regulations,  and  other  measures  that  govern  a  wide  range  of  topics,  including  those related  to  matters  beyond  our  core  products  and  services.  For  instance,  new  laws,  regulations,  policies,  and international accords relating to ESG matters, including sustainability, climate change, human capital, and diversity, are being  developed  and  formalized  in  Europe,  the  U.S.,  and  elsewhere,  which  may  entail  specific,  target-driven frameworks  and/or  disclosure  requirements.  We  have  implemented  robust  ESG  programs,  adopted  reporting frameworks and principles, and announced a number of goals and initiatives. The implementation of these goals and initiatives may require considerable investments, and our goals, with all of their contingencies, dependencies, and in certain cases, reliance on third-party verification and/or performance, are complex and ambitious, may change, and we cannot guarantee that we will achieve them. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to adhere to our public statements, comply  fully  with  developing  interpretations  of  ESG  laws  and  regulations,  or  meet  evolving  and  varied  stakeholder expectations and standards could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities.\n\n19\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nWe are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates are affected by a variety of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates, net gains and losses on hedges and related transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program, decreases in  our  stock  price  for  shares  issued  as  employee  compensation,  changes  in  the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, and the application of different provisions of tax laws or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles (including changes in the interpretation of existing laws). Further, if we are unable  or  fail  to  collect  taxes  on  behalf  of  customers,  employees  and  partners  as  the  withholding  agent,  we  could become liable for taxes that are levied against third parties.\n\nWe are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. As a result, we have received, and may in the future receive, assessments in multiple jurisdictions, on various tax-related assertions, such as transfer-pricing  adjustments or permanent-establishment claims. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could harm our financial condition and operating results, require adverse changes to our business practices, or subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes  and  other  tax  liabilities  requires  significant  judgment  and  often  involves  uncertainty.  Although  we  believe  our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\n\nFurthermore, due to shifting economic and political conditions, tax policies, laws, or rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant changes in ways that could harm our financial condition and operating results. Various jurisdictions around the world have enacted or are considering revenue-based taxes such as digital services taxes and other  targeted  taxes,  which  could  lead  to  inconsistent  and  potentially  overlapping  international  tax  regimes.  The Organization for Economic  Cooperation and Development  continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules.\n\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Stock\n\nWe cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program will be fully consummated or will enhance longterm  stockholder  value,  and  share  repurchases  could  increase  the  volatility  of  our  stock  prices  and  could diminish our cash reserves.\n\nWe  engage  in  share  repurchases  of  our  Class  A  and  Class  C  stock  from  time  to  time  in  accordance  with authorizations from the Board of Directors of Alphabet. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and does  not  obligate  Alphabet  to  repurchase  any  specific  dollar  amount  or  to  acquire  any  specific  number  of  shares. Further, our share repurchases could affect our share trading prices, increase their volatility, reduce our cash reserves and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock.\n\nThe concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders' ability to influence corporate matters.\n\nOur Class B stock has 10 votes per share, our Class A stock has one vote per share, and our Class C stock has no voting rights. As of December 31, 2022, Larry Page and Sergey Brin beneficially owned approximately 85.8% of our outstanding Class B stock, which represented approximately 51.2% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. Through their stock ownership, Larry and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our  assets,  for  the  foreseeable  future.  In  addition,  because  our  Class  C  stock  carries  no  voting  rights (except as required by applicable law), the issuance of the Class C stock, including in future stock-based acquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs, could continue Larry and Sergey's current relative voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our  stockholders.  The  share  repurchases  made  pursuant  to  our  repurchase  program  may  also  affect  Larry  and Sergey's  relative  voting  power.  This  concentrated  control  limits  or  severely  restricts  other  stockholders'  ability  to influence corporate matters and we may take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial, which could reduce the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C stock.\n\nProvisions  in  our  charter  documents  and  under  Delaware  law  could  discourage  a  takeover  that stockholders may consider favorable.\n\nProvisions in Alphabet's certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:\n\nOur Board of Directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of Directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director.\n\nOur stockholders may not act by written consent, which makes it difficult to take certain actions without holding a stockholders' meeting.\n\n20\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nOur certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates.\n\nStockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the Board of Directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders' meeting. These provisions may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer's own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.\n\nOur Board of Directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock, which makes it possible for our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.\n\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its outstanding voting stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the Board of Directors has approved the transaction. Our Board of Directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.\n\nThe trading price for our Class A stock and non-voting Class C stock may continue to be volatile.\n\nThe trading price of our stock has at times experienced significant volatility and may continue to be volatile. In addition  to  the  factors  discussed  in  this  report,  the  trading  prices  of  our  Class  A  stock  and  Class  C  stock  have fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate widely, in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, among others, the activities of our peers and changes in broader economic and political conditions around the world. These broad market and industry factors could harm the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\n\nGeneral Risks\n\nThe continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact are highly unpredictable and could be significant, and could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nOur  business,  operations  and  financial  performance  have  been,  and  may  continue  to  be,  affected  by  the macroeconomic  impacts  resulting  from  COVID-19,  and  as  a  result,  our  revenue  growth  rate  and  expenses  as  a percentage of our revenues in future periods may differ significantly from our historical rates, and our future operating results  may fall  below  expectations.  The  extent  to  which  our  business  will  continue  to  be  affected  will  depend  on  a variety  of  factors,  many  of  which  are  outside  of  our  control,  including  the  persistence  of  the  pandemic,  impacts  on economic activity, and the possibility of recession or continued financial market instability.\n\nOur  operating  results  may  fluctuate,  which  makes  our  results  difficult  to  predict  and  could  cause  our results to fall short of expectations.\n\nOur operating results have fluctuated, and may in the future fluctuate, as a result of a number of factors, many outside  of  our  control,  including  the  cyclicality  and  seasonality  in  our  business  and  geopolitical  events.  As  a  result, comparing our operating results (including our expenses as a percentage of our revenues) on a period-to-period basis may  not  be  meaningful,  and  our  past  results  should  not  be  relied  on  as  an  indication  of  our  future  performance. Consequently, our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations.\n\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other consequences that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures are important elements of our overall corporate strategy and use of capital, and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and operating results. We expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of such potential strategic transactions, which could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Some of the areas where we face risks include:\n\ndiversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions and other strategic transactions;\n\nfailure  to  obtain  required  approvals  on  a  timely  basis,  if  at  all,  from  governmental  authorities,  or  conditions placed upon approval that could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of a transaction;\n\nfailure  to  successfully  integrate  the  acquired  operations,  technologies,  services,  and  personnel  (including cultural integration and retention of employees) and further develop the acquired business or technology;\n\nimplementation or remediation of controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company;\n\n21\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nintegration  of  the  acquired  company's  accounting  and  other  administrative  systems,  and  the  coordination  of product, engineering, and sales and marketing functions;\n\ntransition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms;\n\nin the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries;\n\nfailure  to  accomplish  commercial,  strategic  or  financial  objectives  with  respect  to  investments  and  joint ventures;\n\nfailure to realize the value of investments and joint ventures due to a lack of liquidity;\n\nliability  for  activities  of  the  acquired  company  before  the  acquisition,  including  patent  and  trademark infringement claims, data privacy and security issues, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, warranty claims, product liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities; and\n\nlitigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders, or other third parties.\n\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and other strategic transactions could cause us to fail to realize their anticipated benefits, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally.\n\nOur acquisitions and other strategic transactions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, or impairment of goodwill and/or purchased longlived assets, and restructuring charges, any of which could harm our financial condition and operating results. Also, the anticipated benefits or value of our acquisitions and other strategic transactions may not materialize. In connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.\n\nIf we were to lose the services of key personnel, we may not be able to execute our business strategy.\n\nOur future success depends in large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team. For instance, Sundar Pichai is critical to the overall management of Alphabet and its subsidiaries and plays an important role in the development of our technology, maintaining our culture, and setting our strategic direction. All of our executive officers and key employees are at-will employees, and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies. The loss of key personnel could harm our business.\n\nWe rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel, or maintain and continue to adapt our corporate culture, we may not be able to grow or operate effectively.\n\nOur performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Our ability to compete effectively  and  our  future  success  depends  on  our  continuing  to  identify,  hire,  develop,  motivate,  and  retain  highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense, and certain  of  our  competitors  have  directly  targeted,  and  may  continue  to  target,  our  employees.  In  addition,  our compensation  arrangements,  such  as  our  equity  award  programs,  may  not  always  be  successful  in  attracting  new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Restrictive immigration policy and regulatory changes may also affect our ability to hire, mobilize, or retain some of our global talent.\n\nIn addition, we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. As our organization grows  and  evolves,  we  may  need  to  implement  more  complex  organizational  management  structures  or  adapt  our corporate culture and work environments to ever-changing circumstances, such as during times of a natural disaster or pandemic, and these changes could affect our ability to compete effectively or have an adverse effect on our corporate culture. As we experiment with hybrid work models, we may experience increased costs and/or disruption, in addition to potential effects on our ability to operate effectively and maintain our corporate culture.\n\nITEM 1B.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\n\nAs of October 2, 2015, Alphabet Inc. became the successor issuer of Google Inc. pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) under the Exchange Act. Our Class A stock has been listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol 'GOOG' since August 19, 2004 and under the symbol \"GOOGL\" since April 3, 2014. Prior to August 19, 2004, there was no public market for our stock. Our Class B stock is neither listed nor traded. Our Class C stock has been listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol 'GOOG' since April 3, 2014.\n\nHolders of Record\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, there were approximately 6,670 and 1,657 stockholders of record of our Class A stock and Class C stock, respectively. Because many of our shares of Class A stock and Class C stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders. As of December 31, 2022, there were approximately 64 stockholders of record of our Class B stock.\n\nDividend Policy\n\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common or capital stock. The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long-term growth of the business. We regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace, and form of capital return to stockholders.\n\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\n\nThe following table presents information with respect to Alphabet's repurchases of Class A and Class C stock during the quarter ended December 31, 2022:\n\nThe repurchases are being executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase  program  does  not  have  an  expiration  date.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nPlease read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with 'Note  about  Forward-Looking  Statements,'  Part  I,  Item  1  \"Business,\"  Part  I,  Item  1A  \"Risk  Factors,\"  and  our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nWe have omitted discussion of 2020 results where it would be redundant to the discussion previously included in Item 7 of our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nUnderstanding Alphabet's Financial Results\n\nAlphabet  is  a  collection  of  businesses  -  the  largest  of  which  is  Google.  We  report  Google  in  two  segments, Google Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For further details on our segments, see Part I, Item 1 'Business' and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nTrends in Our Business and Financial Effect\n\nThe following long-term trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate that they will continue to affect our future results:\n\n· Users' behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves.\n\nThe continuing shift from an offline to online world has contributed to the growth of our business and our revenues since inception. We expect that this shift to an online world will continue to benefit our business and our revenues, although  at  a  slower  pace  than  we  have  experienced  historically,  in  particular  after  the  outsized  growth  in  our advertising revenues during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we face increasing competition for user engagement and advertisers, which may affect our revenues.\n\n· Users  continue  to  access  our  products  and  services  using  diverse  devices  and  modalities,  which allows for new advertising formats that may benefit our revenues but adversely affect our margins.\n\nOur users are accessing the Internet via diverse devices and modalities, such as smartphones, wearables, and smart home devices, and want to be able to be connected no matter where they are or what they are doing. We are focused on expanding our products and services to stay in front of these trends in order to maintain and grow our business.\n\nWe benefit from advertising revenues generated from different channels, including mobile, and newer advertising formats. The margins from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional desktop search. Additionally, as the market for a particular device type or modality matures, our advertising revenues may be affected. For example, growth in the global smartphone market has slowed due to various factors, including increased market saturation in developed countries, which can affect our mobile advertising revenues.\n\nWe expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our revenues grow and TAC as a percentage of our advertising revenues (\"TAC rate\") to be affected by changes in device mix; geographic mix; partner mix; partner agreement terms; the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points; product mix; the relative revenue growth rates of advertising revenues from different channels; and revenue share terms.\n\nWe expect these trends to continue to affect our revenues and put pressure on our margins.\n\n· As  online  advertising  evolves,  we  continue  to  expand  our  product  offerings,  which  may  affect  our monetization.\n\nAs  interactions  between  users  and  advertisers  change,  and  as  online  user  behavior  evolves,  we  continue  to expand  our  product  offerings  to  serve  these  changing  needs,  which  may  affect  our  monetization.  For  example, revenues from ads on YouTube and Google Play monetize at a lower rate than our traditional search ads. We also may develop  new  products  incorporating  AI  innovations  that  could  affect  our  monetization  trends.  Additionally,  when developing new products and services we generally focus first on user experience before prioritizing monetization.\n\n· As users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets continue  to  increase,  and  may  require  continued  investments.  In  addition,  movements  in  foreign  exchange rates affect such revenues.\n\nThe shift to online, as well as the advent of the multi-device world, has brought opportunities outside of the U.S., including  in  emerging  markets,  such  as  India.  We  continue  to  invest  heavily  and  develop  localized  versions  of  our products and advertising programs relevant to our users in these markets. This has led to a trend of increased\n\n26\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nrevenues from emerging markets. We expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these markets,  particularly  as  low-cost  mobile  devices  become  more  available.  This  trend  could  affect  our  revenues  as developing markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets.\n\nInternational revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency  exchange  rates  relative  to  the  U.S.  dollar.  While  we  have  a  foreign  exchange  risk  management  program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings.\n\n· The  revenues  that  we  derive  from  non-advertising  products  and  services  are  increasing  and  may adversely affect our margins.\n\nNon-advertising revenues have grown over time, and we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our products and services. The margins on these revenues vary significantly and are generally lower than the margins on our advertising revenues. In particular margins on our hardware products adversely affect our consolidated margins due to pressures on pricing and higher cost of sales.\n\n· As we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and capital expenditures.\n\nWe continue to make significant research and development investments in areas of strategic focus as we seek to develop new, innovative offerings and improve our existing offerings across our businesses. We also expect to continue to invest in our technical infrastructure, including servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of  our  business  and  our  long-term  initiatives,  in  particular  in  support  of  AI.  In  addition  acquisitions  and  strategic investments  contribute  to  the  breadth  and  depth  of  our  offerings,  expand  our  expertise  in  engineering  and  other functional areas, and build strong partnerships around strategic initiatives. For example, in September 2022 we closed the acquisition of Mandiant to help expand our offerings in dynamic cyber defense and response.\n\n· We face continuing changes in regulatory conditions, laws, and public policies, which could affect our business practices and financial results.\n\nChanges in social, political,  economic,  tax,  and  regulatory  conditions  or  in  laws  and  policies  governing  a  wide range of topics and related legal matters have resulted in fines and caused us to change our business practices. As these global trends continue, our cost of doing business may increase, our ability to pursue certain business models or offer  certain  products  or  services  may  be  limited,  and  we  may  need  to  change  our  business  practices.  Examples include  the  antitrust  complaints  filed  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  and  a  number  of  state  Attorneys  General; pending  litigation  in  the  U.S.,  EU,  and  around  the  world  that  could  diminish  or  eliminate  safe  harbor  protection  for websites and online platforms; and the Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act in Europe and various legislative proposals in the U.S. focused on large technology platforms. For additional information see Item 1A Risk Factors and Legal Matters in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8.\n\n· Our employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them.\n\nOur employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. We expect to continue hiring talented employees around the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs. For additional information see Culture and Workforce in Part I, Item 1 'Business.'\n\nRevenues and Monetization Metrics\n\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based  products.  For  details  on  how  we  recognize  revenue,  see  Note  1  of  the  Notes  to  Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  long-term  trends  and  their  financial  effect  on  our  business  noted  above,  fluctuations  in  our revenues have been and may continue to be affected by a combination of factors, including:\n\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\nchanges in pricing, such as those resulting from changes in fee structures, discounts, and customer incentives;\n\ngeneral  economic  conditions  and  various  external  dynamics,  including  geopolitical  events,  regulations,  and other measures and their effect on advertiser, consumer, and enterprise spending;\n\nnew product and service launches; and\n\n27\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nseasonality.\n\nAdditionally, fluctuations in our revenues generated from advertising (\"Google advertising\"), revenues from other sources  (\"Google  other  revenues\"),  Google  Cloud,  and  Other  Bets  revenues  have  been  and  may  continue  to  be affected by other factors unique to each set of revenues, as described below.\n\nGoogle Services\n\nGoogle Services revenues consist of Google advertising as well as Google other revenues.\n\nGoogle Advertising\n\nGoogle advertising revenues are comprised of the following:\n\nGoogle Search & other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n\nYouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and\n\nGoogle Network, which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\n\nWe  use  certain  metrics  to  track  how  well  traffic  across  various  properties  is  monetized  as  it  relates  to  our advertising  revenues:  paid  clicks  and  cost-per-click  pertain  to  traffic  on  Google  Search  &  other  properties,  while impressions and cost-per-impression pertain to traffic on our Google Network properties.\n\nPaid clicks represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users on Google search properties and other Google owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play. Cost-perclick is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.\n\nImpressions  include  impressions  displayed  to  users  on  Google  Network  properties  participating  primarily  in AdMob,  AdSense,  and  Google  Ad  Manager.  Cost-per-impression  is  defined  as  impression-based  and  click-based revenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each impression displayed to users.\n\nAs our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues generated by the corresponding click and impression activity.\n\nFluctuations in our advertising revenues, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search &  other  properties  and  the  change  in  impressions  and  cost-per-impression  on  Google  Network  properties  and  the correlation between these items have been and may continue to be affected by additional factors, such as:\n\nadvertiser competition for keywords;\n\nchanges in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy;\n\nchanges in device mix;\n\nseasonal  fluctuations  in  internet  usage,  advertising  expenditures,  and  underlying  business  trends,  such  as traditional retail seasonality; and\n\ntraffic  growth  in  emerging  markets  compared  to  more  mature  markets  and  across  various  verticals  and channels.\n\nGoogle Other\n\nGoogle other revenues are comprised of the following:\n\nGoogle Play, which includes sales of apps and in-app purchases;\n\nhardware, which includes sales of Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, and Pixel devices;\n\nYouTube non-advertising, which includes subscription revenues from services such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV; and\n\nother products and services.\n\n28\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nFluctuations in our Google other revenues have been and may continue to be affected by additional factors, such as changes in customer usage and demand, number of subscribers, and fluctuations in the timing of product launches.\n\nGoogle Cloud\n\nGoogle Cloud revenues are comprised of the following:\n\nGoogle Cloud Platform, which includes fees for infrastructure, platform, and other services;\n\nGoogle Workspace, which includes fees for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for enterprises, such as Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar and Meet; and\n\nother enterprise services.\n\nFluctuations in our Google Cloud revenues have been and may continue to be affected by additional factors, such as customer usage.\n\nOther Bets\n\nRevenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\n\nCosts and Expenses\n\nOur  cost  structure  has  two  components:  cost  of  revenues  and  operating  expenses.  Our  operating  expenses include costs related to R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of our costs and expenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue.\n\nCost of Revenues\n\nCost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues.\n\nTAC includes:\n\nAmounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers.\n\nAmounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n\nOther cost of revenues includes:\n\nContent acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other  content  for  distribution  on  YouTube  and  Google  Play  (we  pay  fees  to  these  content  providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee).\n\nExpenses associated with our data centers (including bandwidth, compensation expenses, depreciation, energy, and other equipment costs) as well as other operations costs (such as content review as well as customer and product support costs).\n\nInventory and other costs related to the hardware we sell.\n\nTAC  as  a  percentage  of  revenues  generated  from  ads  placed  on  Google  Network  properties  are  significantly higher  than  TAC  as  a  percentage  of  revenues  generated  from  ads  placed  on  Google  Search  &  other  properties, because  most  of  the  advertiser  revenues  from  ads  served  on  Google  Network  properties  are  paid  as  TAC  to  our Google Network partners.\n\nOperating Expenses\n\nOperating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as either R&D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative.\n\nThe main components of our R&D expenses are:\n\ncompensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&D related to our existing and new products and services;\n\ndepreciation; and\n\nthird-party services fees primarily relating to consulting and outsourced services in support of our engineering and product development efforts.\n\n29\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nThe main components of our sales and marketing expenses are:\n\ncompensation expenses for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain customer service functions; and\n\nspending relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services.\n\nThe main components of our general and administrative expenses are:\n\ncompensation expenses for employees in finance, human resources, information technology, legal, and other administrative support functions;\n\nexpenses relating to legal matters, including fines and settlements; and\n\nthird-party  services  fees,  including  audit,  consulting,  outside  legal,  and  other  outsourced  administrative services.\n\nOther Income (Expense), Net\n\nOther  income  (expense),  net  primarily  consists  of  interest  income  (expense),  the  effect  of  foreign  currency exchange  gains  (losses),  net  gains  (losses)  and  impairment  on  our  marketable  and  non-marketable  securities, performance fees, and income (loss) and impairment from our equity method investments.\n\nFor additional details, including how we account for our investments and factors that can drive fluctuations in the value of our investments, see Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as Item 7A, 'Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk'.\n\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\nProvision for income taxes represents the estimated amount of federal, state, and foreign income taxes incurred in the U.S. and the many jurisdictions in which we operate. The provision includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties.\n\nFor additional details, including a reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory rate to our effective tax rate, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nExecutive Overview\n\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated financial results (in millions, except for per share information and percentages):\n\nSee \"Use of Non-GAAP Constant Currency Measures\" below for details relating to our use of constant currency information. (1)\n\nRevenues were $282.8 billion, an increase of 10% year over year, primarily driven by an increase in Google Services revenues of $16.0 billion, or 7%, and an increase in Google Cloud revenues of $7.1 billion, or 37%.\n\nTotal constant currency revenues, which exclude the effect of hedging, increased 14% year over year.\n\n30\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nCost of revenues was $126.2 billion, an increase of 14% year over year, primarily driven by an increase in other costs of revenues.\n\nOperating expenses were $81.8 billion, an increase of 20% year over year, primarily driven by increases in compensation expenses due to headcount growth, third-party service fees, and advertising and promotional expenses.\n\nOther information:\n\nOn September 12, 2022, we closed the acquisition of Mandiant for a total purchase price of $6.1 billion and added more than 2,600 employees. Mandiant's financial results are reported within Google Cloud as of the acquisition  date.  See  Note  8  of  the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included  in  Item  8  of  this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n\nOn July 15, 2022, the company executed a 20-for-one stock split with a record date of July 1, 2022, effected in the form of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the company's Class A, Class B, and Class C stock.  All  prior  period  references  made  to  share  or  per  share  amounts  throughout  this  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations prior to the effective date have been retroactively  adjusted  to  reflect  the  effects  of  the  Stock  Split.  See  Note  11  of  the  Notes  to  Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2022, we suspended the vast majority of our commercial activities in Russia and effectively ceased business activities of our Russian entity. The ongoing effect of these direct actions on our financial results was not material. The broader economic effects resulting from the war in Ukraine on our future financial results may be unpredictable.\n\nRepurchases of Class A and Class C shares were $59.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n\nOperating cash flow was $91.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\nCapital expenditures, which primarily reflected investments in technical infrastructure, were $31.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had 190,234 employees.\n\nAdditionally, looking ahead to fiscal year 2023:\n\nIn January 2023, we announced a reduction of our workforce of approximately 12,000 roles. We expect to incur employee severance and related charges of $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion, the majority of which will be recognized in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nIn addition, we are taking actions to optimize our global office space. As a result we expect to incur exit costs relating  to  office  space  reductions  of  approximately  $0.5  billion  in  the  first  quarter  of  2023.  We  may  incur additional charges in the future as we further evaluate our real estate needs.\n\nIn  January  2023,  we  completed  an  assessment  of  the  useful  lives  of  our  servers  and  network  equipment, resulting in a change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment to six years, which we expect to result in a reduction of depreciation of approximately $3.4 billion for the full fiscal year 2023 for assets in service as of December 31, 2022, recorded primarily in cost of revenues and R&D expenses.\n\nAs AI is critical to delivering our mission of bringing our breakthrough innovations into the real world, beginning in January 2023, we will update our segment reporting relating to certain of Alphabet's AI activities. DeepMind, previously  reported  within  Other  Bets,  will  be  reported  as  part  of  Alphabet's  corporate  costs,  reflecting  its increasing collaboration with Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets. Prior periods will be recast to conform to the revised presentation. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information relating to our segments.\n\n31\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nFinancial Results\n\nRevenues\n\nThe following table presents revenues by type (in millions):\n\nGoogle Services\n\nGoogle advertising revenues\n\nGoogle Search & other\n\nGoogle Search & other revenues increased $13.5 billion from 2021 to 2022. The growth was driven by interrelated factors  including  increases  in  search  queries  resulting  from  growth  in  user  adoption  and  usage,  primarily  on  mobile devices;  growth  in  advertiser  spending;  and  improvements  we  have  made  in  ad  formats  and  delivery.  Growth  was adversely affected by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nYouTube ads\n\nYouTube ads revenues increased $398 million from 2021 to 2022. The growth was driven by our brand advertising products followed by direct response products, both of which benefited from increased spending by our advertisers as well as improvements to ad formats and delivery. Growth was adversely affected by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nGoogle Network\n\nGoogle Network revenues increased $1.1 billion from 2021 to 2022. The growth was primarily driven by strength in AdSense and AdMob. Growth was adversely affected by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nMonetization Metrics\n\nPaid clicks and cost-per-click\n\nThe following table presents changes in paid clicks and cost-per-click (expressed as a percentage) from 2021 to 2022:\n\nPaid clicks increased from 2021 to 2022 driven by a number of interrelated factors, including an increase in search queries resulting from growth in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices; growth in advertiser spending; and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery.\n\nCost-per-click decreased from 2021 to 2022 driven by a number of interrelated factors including changes in device mix, geographic mix, advertiser spending, ongoing product changes, and property mix, as well as the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates.\n\n32\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nImpressions and cost-per-impression\n\nThe following table presents changes in impressions and cost-per-impression (expressed as a percentage) from 2021 to 2022:\n\nImpressions increased from 2021 to 2022 primarily driven by Google Ad Manager and AdMob. The increase in cost-per-impression from 2021 to 2022 was driven by a number of interrelated factors including ongoing product and policy  changes,  improvements  we  have  made  in  ad  formats  and  delivery,  changes  in  device  mix,  geographic  mix, product mix, and property mix, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nGoogle other revenues\n\nGoogle  other  revenues  increased  $1.0  billion  from  2021  to  2022  primarily  driven  by  growth  in  YouTube  nonadvertising and hardware revenues, partially offset by a decrease in Google Play revenues. The growth in YouTube non-advertising was largely due to an increase in paid subscribers. The growth in hardware was primarily driven by increased  sales  of  Pixel  devices.  The  decrease  in  Google  Play  revenues  was  primarily  driven  by  the  fee  structure changes we announced in 2021 as well as a decrease in buyer spending. Additionally, the overall increase in Google other revenues was adversely affected by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nGoogle Cloud\n\nGoogle Cloud revenues increased $7.1 billion from 2021 to 2022. The growth was primarily driven by Google Cloud Platform followed by Google Workspace offerings. Google Cloud's infrastructure and platform services were the largest drivers of growth in Google Cloud Platform.\n\nRevenues by Geography\n\nThe  following  table  presents  revenues  by  geography  as  a  percentage  of  revenues,  determined  based  on  the addresses of our customers:\n\nFor  further  details  on  revenues  by  geography,  see  Note  2  of  the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Constant Currency Information\n\nInternational revenues, which represent a significant portion of our revenues, are generally transacted in multiple currencies and therefore are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nThe effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons.  We  use  non-GAAP  constant  currency  revenues  (\"constant  currency  revenues\")  and  non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for financial and  operational  decision-making  and  as  a  means  to  evaluate  period-to-period  comparisons.  We  believe  the presentation  of  results  on  a  constant  currency  basis  in  addition  to  U.S.  Generally  Accepted  Accounting  Principles (GAAP) results helps improve the ability  to  understand  our  performance,  because  it  excludes  the  effects  of  foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.\n\nConstant currency information  compares  results  between  periods  as  if  exchange  rates  had  remained  constant period over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.\n\n33\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nConstant  currency  revenue  percentage  change  is  calculated  by  determining  the  change  in  current  period revenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods.\n\nThese results  should  be  considered  in  addition  to,  not  as  a  substitute  for,  results  reported  in  accordance  with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nThe following table presents the foreign exchange effect on international revenues and total revenues (in millions, except percentages):\n\nTotal  constant  currency revenues of $294.2 billion for 2022 increased $36.7 billion compared to $257.5 billion in revenues, excluding hedging effect for 2021. (1)\n\nEMEA revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Euro and the British pound.\n\nAPAC revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Japanese yen and the Australian dollar.\n\nOther Americas growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Argentine peso.\n\nCosts and Expenses\n\nCost of Revenues\n\nThe following table presents cost of revenues, including TAC (in millions, except percentages):\n\nCost of revenues increased $15.3 billion from 2021 to 2022. The increase was due to an increase in other cost of revenues and TAC of $11.9 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively.\n\nThe increase in TAC from 2021 to 2022 was due to an increase in TAC paid to distribution partners and to Google Network partners, primarily driven by growth in revenues subject to TAC. The TAC rate was 22% in both 2021 and 2022. The TAC rate on Google Search & other revenues and the TAC rate on Google Network revenues were both substantially consistent from 2021 to 2022.\n\nThe increase in other cost of revenues from 2021 to 2022 was primarily due to increases in data center costs and other operations costs as well as hardware costs.\n\n34\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nResearch and Development\n\nThe following table presents R&D expenses (in millions, except percentages):\n\nR&D  expenses  increased  $7.9  billion  from  2021  to  2022  primarily  driven  by  an  increase  in  compensation expenses of $5.4 billion, largely resulting from a 21% increase in average headcount, and an increase in third-party service fees of $704 million.\n\nSales and Marketing\n\nThe following table presents sales and marketing expenses (in millions, except percentages):\n\nSales  and  marketing  expenses  increased  $3.7  billion  from  2021  to  2022,  primarily  driven  by  an  increase  in compensation expenses of $1.8 billion, largely resulting from a 19% increase in average headcount, and an increase in advertising and promotional activities of $1.3 billion.\n\nGeneral and Administrative\n\nThe following table presents general and administrative expenses (in millions, except percentages):\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $2.2 billion from 2021 to 2022. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in compensation expenses of $1.1 billion, largely resulting from a 21% increase in average headcount, and  an  increase  in  third-party  services  fees  of  $815  million.  In  addition,  there  was  a  $551  million  increase  to  the allowance  for  credit  losses  for  accounts  receivable,  as  the  prior  year  comparable  period  reflected  a  decline  in  the allowance.\n\nSegment Profitability\n\nThe following table presents segment operating income (loss) (in millions).\n\nUnallocated corporate costs primarily include corporate initiatives, corporate shared costs, such as finance and legal, including certain  fines  and  settlements,  as  well  as  costs  associated  with  certain  shared  R&D  activities.  Additionally,  hedging  gains (losses)  related  to  revenue  are  included  in  corporate  costs  and  totaled  $149  million  and  $2.0  billion  in  2021  and  2022, respectively. (1)\n\nGoogle Services\n\nGoogle Services operating income decreased $5.3 billion from 2021 to 2022. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by increases in compensation expenses and TAC, partially offset by growth in revenues.\n\n35\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nGoogle Cloud\n\nGoogle  Cloud  operating  loss  decreased  $131  million  from  2021  to  2022.  The  decrease  in  operating  loss  was primarily driven by growth in revenues, partially offset by an increase in compensation expenses.\n\nOther Bets\n\nOther Bets operating loss increased $802 million from 2021 to 2022. The increase in operating loss was primarily driven by increases in compensation expenses, partially offset by growth in revenues.\n\nOther Income (Expense), Net\n\nThe following table presents other income (expense), net, (in millions):\n\nOther income (expense), net, decreased $15.5 billion from 2021 to 2022 primarily due to changes in gains and losses on equity securities and performance fees. In 2022, $3.2 billion of net unrealized losses were recognized on marketable equity securities and $1.5 billion of net realized losses were recognized on debt securities. These losses were partially offset by interest income of $2.2 billion and reversals of previously accrued performance fees related to certain investments of $798 million. In 2021, $9.8 billion of net unrealized gains were recognized on non-marketable equity  securities  and  $1.5  billion  of  interest  income  was  recognized,  partially  offset  by  $1.9  billion  of  accrued performance fees related to certain investments.\n\nSee Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\n\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\nThe following table presents provision for income taxes (in millions, except for effective tax rate):\n\nThe  effective  tax  rate  decreased  from  2021  to  2022,  primarily  driven  by  the  effects  of  capitalization  and amortization of R&D expenses in 2022 as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act generating an increase in the U.S. federal Foreign Derived Intangible Income tax deduction. The decrease was partially offset by a decrease in pretax earnings, including in countries that have lower statutory rates and a decrease in the stock-based compensation related tax benefit. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\n\nFinancial Condition\n\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $113.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities. Cash  equivalents  and  marketable  securities  are  comprised  of  time  deposits,  money  market  funds,  highly  liquid government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, and marketable equity securities.\n\nSources, Uses of Cash, and Related Trends\n\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from operations. The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long-term growth of the business. We regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace, and form of capital return to stockholders.\n\n36\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nThe following table presents our cash flows (in millions):\n\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\n\nOur largest source of cash provided by operations are advertising revenues generated by Google Search & other properties, Google Network properties, and YouTube properties. Additionally, we generate cash through sales of apps and  in-app  purchases,  and  hardware;  and  licensing  and  service  fees,  including  fees  received  for  Google  Cloud offerings and subscription-based products.\n\nOur primary uses of cash from operating activities include payments to distribution and Google Network partners, to  employees  for  compensation,  and  to  content  providers.  Other  uses  of  cash  from  operating  activities  include payments to suppliers for hardware, to tax authorities for income taxes, and other general corporate expenditures.\n\nNet  cash  provided  by  operating  activities  decreased  from  2021  to  2022  primarily  due  to  the  net  effect  of  an increase in cash received from revenues, offset by increases in cash paid for cost of revenues and operating expenses and an increase in tax payments driven by the effects of capitalization and amortization of R&D expenses beginning in 2022 as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n\nCash Used in Investing Activities\n\nCash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of investments in marketable and non-marketable securities.  Cash  used  in  investing  activities  consists  primarily  of  purchases  of  marketable  and  nonmarketable securities, purchases of property and equipment, and payments for acquisitions.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased from 2021 to 2022 as a result of a decrease in net purchases of and  maturities  and  sales  of  marketable  securities,  partially  offset  by  an  increase  in  purchases  of  property  and equipment.\n\nCash Used in Financing Activities\n\nCash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from the sale of interest in consolidated entities. Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of stock, net payments related to stock-based award activities, and repayments of debt.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities increased from 2021 to 2022 primarily due to an increase in repurchases of stock.\n\nLiquidity and Material Cash Requirements\n\nWe  expect  existing  cash,  cash  equivalents,  short-term  marketable  securities,  cash  flows  from  operations  and financing activities to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\n\nCapital Expenditures and Leases\n\nWe  make  investments  in  land  and  buildings  for  data  centers  and  offices  and  information  technology  assets through  purchases  of  property  and  equipment  and  lease  arrangements  to  provide  capacity  for  the  growth  of  our services and products.\n\nCapital Expenditures\n\nOur capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories:\n\ntechnical infrastructure,  which  consists  of  our  investments  in  servers  and  network  equipment  for  computing, storage, and networking requirements for ongoing business activities, including AI, (collectively referred to as our information technology assets) and data center land and building construction; and\n\noffice facilities, ground-up development projects, and building improvements (also referred to as \"fit-outs\").\n\nConstruction in progress consists primarily of technical infrastructure and office facilities which have not yet been placed in  service.  The  time  frame  from  date  of  purchase  to  placement  in  service  of  these  assets  may  extend  from months to years. For example, our data center construction projects are generally multi-year projects with multiple\n\n37\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nphases,  where  we  acquire  qualified  land  and  buildings,  construct  buildings,  and  secure  and  install  information technology assets.\n\nDuring  the  years  ended  December  31,  2021  and  2022,  we  spent  $24.6  billion  and  $31.5  billion  on  capital expenditures,  respectively.  Depreciation  of  our  property  and  equipment  commences  when  the  deployment  of  such assets are completed and are ready for our intended use. Land is not depreciated. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, our depreciation and impairment expenses on property and equipment were $11.6 billion and $15.3 billion, respectively.\n\nLeases\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, we recognized total operating lease assets of $3.0 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the amount of total future lease payments under operating leases, which had a weighted average remaining lease term of 8 years, was $17.4 billion, of which $3.0 billion is short-term. As of December 31, 2022, we have entered into leases that have not yet commenced with future short-term and long-term lease payments of $630 million and $3.1 billion that are not yet recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These leases will commence between 2023 and 2026 with non-cancelable lease terms of 1 to 25 years.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, our operating lease expenses (including variable lease costs) were $3.4 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. Finance lease costs were not material for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022. See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on leases.\n\nFinancing\n\nWe have a short-term debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2022, we had no commercial paper outstanding.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, $4.0 billion expiring in April 2023 and $6.0 billion expiring in April 2026. The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using certain market rates, as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals. No amounts have been borrowed under the credit facilities.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with a total carrying value of $12.9 billion with short-term and long-term future interest payments of $231 million and $3.8 billion, respectively. See Note 6 of the Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included  in  Item  8  of  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  for  further information on our debt.\n\nWe primarily utilize contract manufacturers for the assembly of our servers used in our technical infrastructure and hardware products we sell. We have agreements where we may purchase components directly from suppliers and then supply these components to contract manufacturers for use in the assembly of the servers and hardware products. Certain of these arrangements result in a portion of the cash received from and paid to the contract manufacturers to be presented as financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on From 10-K.\n\nShare Repurchase Program\n\nIn April 2022, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares. As of December 31, 2022, $28.1 billion remains available for Class A and Class C share repurchases. In accordance with the authorization of the Board of Directors of Alphabet, during 2022 we repurchased and subsequently retired 530 million shares for $59.3 billion. Of the aggregate amount repurchased and subsequently retired, 61 million shares were Class A stock for $6.7 billion and 469 million shares were Class C stock for $52.6 billion. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nEuropean Commission Fines\n\nIn 2017, 2018 and 2019, the EC announced decisions that certain actions taken by Google infringed European competition  law  and  imposed  fines  of  €2.4  billion  ($2.7  billion  as  of  June  27,  2017),  €4.3  billion  ($5.1  billion  as  of June 30, 2018), and €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019), respectively. On September 14, 2022, the General Court reduced the 2018 fine from €4.3 billion to €4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal to the European Court of Justice. In 2018 we recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in 2022.\n\nWhile each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines. For\n\n38\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nfurther details, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nTaxes\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had short-term and long-term income taxes payable of $1.6 billion and $4.2 billion related  to  a  one-time  transition  tax  payable  incurred  as  a  result  of  the  U.S.  Tax  Cuts  and  Jobs  Act  (\"Tax  Act\"). As permitted by the Tax Act, we will pay the transition tax in annual interest-free installments through 2025. We also have taxes payable of $5.1 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2022.\n\nPurchase Commitments\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had material non-cancelable contractual obligations of $32.0 billion, of which $17.3 billion  was  short-term.  These  amounts  represent  the  non-cancelable  portion  of  agreements  or  the  minimum cancellation fee and are primarily related to commitments to purchase licenses, technical infrastructure, inventory, and network capacity. For those agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of December 31, 2022.\n\nIn  addition  we  regularly  enter  into  multi-year,  non-cancellable  agreements  to  purchase  renewable  energy  and energy  attributes,  such  as  renewable  energy  certificates.  These  agreements  do  not  include  a  minimum  dollar commitment. The amounts to be paid under these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated and are not readily determinable.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n\nWe  prepare  our  consolidated  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  GAAP.  In  doing  so,  we  have  to  make estimates  and  assumptions.  Our  critical  accounting  estimates  are  those  estimates  that  involve  a  significant  level  of uncertainty  at  the  time  the  estimate  was  made,  and  changes  in  them  have  had  or  are  reasonably  likely  to  have  a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We have reviewed our critical accounting estimates with the Audit and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors.\n\nSee Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements.\n\nFair Value Measurements of Non-Marketable Equity Securities\n\nWe measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, consisting primarily of our nonmarketable equity securities. These investments are accounted for under the measurement alternative method (\"the measurement alternative\") and are measured at cost, less impairment, subject to upward and downward adjustments resulting  from  observable  price  changes  for  identical  or  similar  investments  of  the  same  issuer.  These  adjustments require quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities, which may require the use of unobservable inputs. Pricing adjustments are determined by using various valuation methodologies and involve the use of estimates using the best information available, which may include cash flow projections or other available market data.\n\nNon-marketable  equity  securities  are  also  evaluated  for  impairment,  based  on  qualitative  factors  including  the companies'  financial  and  liquidity  position  and  access  to  capital  resources,  among  others.  When  indicators  of impairment exist, we prepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income approach, which requires judgment and the use of unobservable inputs, including discount rates,  investee  revenues  and  costs,  and  comparable  market  data  of  private  and  public  companies,  among  others. When the quantitative remeasurements of fair value indicate an impairment exists, we write down the investment to its current fair value.\n\nWe also have compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain investments, i.e. performance fees. We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may result in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use of unobservable inputs.\n\nProperty and Equipment\n\nWe assess the reasonableness of the useful lives of our property and equipment periodically as well as when other changes occur, such as when there are changes to ongoing business operations, changes in the planned use and utilization  of  assets,  or  technological  advancements,  that  could  indicate  a  change  in  the  period  over  which  we expect to benefit from the assets.\n\n39\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.\n\nRecording an uncertain tax position involves various qualitative considerations, including evaluation of comparable and resolved tax exposures, applicability of tax laws, and likelihood of settlement. We evaluate uncertain tax positions periodically, considering changes in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or recent judicial opinions, as well as the status of audit activities by taxing authorities. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made.\n\nThe  provision  for  income  taxes  includes  the  effect  of  reserve  provisions  and  changes  to  reserves  that  are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Services (IRS) and other tax authorities which may assert  assessments  against  us.  We  regularly  assess  the  likelihood  of  adverse  outcomes  resulting  from  these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.\n\nLoss Contingencies\n\nWe are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury consumer protection, and other matters. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nWe evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our disclosures as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters. Until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material.\n\nChange in Accounting Estimate\n\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment, resulting in a change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment to six years, which we expect to result in a reduction of depreciation of approximately $3.4 billion for the full fiscal year 2023 for assets in service as of December  31,  2022,  recorded  primarily  in  cost  of  revenues  and  R&D  expenses.  See  Note  1  of  the  Notes  to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information relating to the useful lives of our servers and network equipment.\n\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity investment risks.\n\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\n\nWe  transact  business  globally  in  multiple  currencies.  International  revenues,  as  well  as  costs  and  expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S.  dollar.  Principal  currencies  hedged  included  the  Australian  dollar,  British  pound,  Canadian  dollar,  Euro,  and Japanese yen. For the purpose of analyzing foreign currency exchange risk, we considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% could be experienced.\n\nWe use foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. These forward and option contracts reduce,  but  do  not  entirely  eliminate,  the  effect  of  foreign  currency  exchange  rate  movements  on  our  assets  and liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on these assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, which are offset by the gains and losses on the forward and option contracts.\n\n40\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nIf  an  adverse 10% foreign currency exchange rate change was applied to total monetary assets, liabilities, and commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies at the balance sheet date, it would have resulted  in  an  adverse  effect  on  income  before  income  taxes  of  approximately  $285  million  and  $136  million  as  of December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively, after consideration of the effect of foreign exchange contracts in place for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022.\n\nWe  use  foreign  currency  forward  and  option  contracts,  including  collars  (an  option  strategy  comprised  of  a combination of purchased and written options) to protect forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. When the U.S. dollar strengthens, gains from foreign currency forward and option contacts reduce the foreign currency losses related to our earnings. When the U.S. dollar weakens, losses from foreign currency  forward  and  option  contracts  offset  the  foreign  currency  gains  related  to  our  earnings.  These  hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. We reflect the gains or losses of foreign currency spot rate changes as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and subsequently reclassify them into revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur.\n\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10% as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our cash flow hedges before tax effect would have been approximately $1.3 billion lower for both December 31, 2021 and 2022. The change in the value recorded in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency change in forecasted hedged revenues when recognized.\n\nWe use foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks  related  to  investment  in  foreign  subsidiaries.  These  forward  contracts  serve  to  offset  the  foreign  currency translation risk from our foreign operations.\n\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10%, the amount recorded in cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) within AOCI related to our net investment hedges before tax effect would have been approximately $975 million and $903 million lower as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. The change in value recorded in CTA would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency translation gain or loss from our investment in foreign subsidiaries.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nOur  Corporate  Treasury  investment  strategy  is  to  achieve  a  return  that  will  allow  us  to  preserve  capital  and maintain  liquidity.  We  invest  primarily  in  debt  securities,  including  government  bonds,  corporate  debt  securities, mortgage-backed  and  asset-backed  securities,  money  market  and  other  funds,  time  deposits,  and  interest  rate derivatives. By policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and floating  rate  interest  earning  securities  carry  a  degree  of  interest  rate  risk.  Fixed  rate  securities  may  have  their  fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. Unrealized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to interest rate fluctuations as compared to interest rates at the time of purchase. For certain fixed and variable rate debt securities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in other income (expense), net.  We  measure  securities  for  which  we  have  not  elected  the  fair  value  option  at  fair  value  with  gains  and  losses recorded in AOCI until the securities are sold, less any expected credit losses.\n\nWe use value-at-risk (VaR) analysis to determine the potential effect of fluctuations in interest rates on the value of our marketable debt security portfolio. The VaR is the expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, for our investment portfolio due to adverse movements in interest rates. We use a variance/covariance VaR model with 95% confidence interval. The estimated one-day loss in fair value of marketable debt securities as of December 31, 2021 and 2022 are shown below (in millions):\n\nActual future gains and losses associated with our marketable debt security portfolio may differ materially from the sensitivity  analyses  performed  as  of  December  31,  2021  and  2022  due  to  the  inherent  limitations  associated  with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates and our actual exposures and positions. VaR analysis is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation.\n\nEquity Investment Risk\n\nOur marketable and non-marketable equity securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings.\n\n41\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nOur marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds and our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages.\n\nWe record marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily determinable market values, of which publicly traded stocks and mutual funds are subject to market price volatility, and represent  $7.8  billion  and  $5.2  billion  of  our  investments  as  of  December  31,  2021  and  2022,  respectively.  A hypothetical  adverse  price  change  of  10%  on  our  December  31,  2022  balance  would  decrease  the  fair  value  of marketable equity securities by $516 million. From time to time, we may enter into derivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities.\n\nOur non-marketable equity securities  not  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  are  adjusted  to  fair  value  for observable  transactions  for  identical  or  similar  investments  of  the  same  issuer  or  impairment  (referred  to  as  the measurement alternative).  The  fair  value  measured  at  the  time  of  the  observable  transaction  is  not  necessarily  an indication of the current fair value as of the balance sheet date. These investments, especially those that are in the early stages, are inherently risky because the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early phases and may never materialize, and they may experience a decline in financial condition, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies. Valuations of our equity investments in private  companies  are  inherently  more  complex  due  to  the  lack  of  readily  available  market  data  and  observable transactions at lower valuations could result in significant losses. In addition, global economic conditions could result in additional volatility. The success of our investment in any private company is also typically dependent on the likelihood of  our  ability  to  realize  appreciation  in  the  value  of  investments  through  liquidity  events  such  as  public  offerings, acquisitions, private sales or other market events. Changes in the valuation of non-marketable equity securities may not directly correlate with changes in valuation of marketable equity securities. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities, which were accounted for under the measurement alternative, was $27.6 billion and $28.5 billion, respectively.\n\nThe  carrying values of our equity method  investments,  which  totaled  approximately  $1.5  billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes. However, these investments could be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value and is not expected to recover.\n\nFor  further  information  about  our  equity  investments,  see  Note  1  and  Note  3  of  the  Notes  to  Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n42\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n43\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Alphabet Inc.\n\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alphabet Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule  listed  in  the  Index  at  Item  15  (collectively  referred  to  as  the  'consolidated  financial  statements').  In  our opinion,  the  consolidated  financial  statements  present  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the  financial  position  of  the Company at December 31, 2021 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 2, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  financial  statements  are  free  of  material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nCritical Audit Matter\n\nThe  critical  audit  matter  communicated  below  is  a  matter  arising  from  the  current  period  audit  of  the  financial statements that  was  communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts  or  disclosures  that  are  material  to  the  financial  statements  and  (2)  involved  our  especially  challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.\n\n44\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nLoss Contingencies\n\nDescription of the Matter The  Company  is  regularly  subject  to  claims,  lawsuits,  regulatory  and  government  investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security,  tax  and  related  compliance,  labor  and  employment,  commercial  disputes,  content generated  by  its  users,  goods  and  services  offered  by  advertisers  or  publishers  using  their platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. As described in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 'Commitments and contingencies' such claims, lawsuits, regulatory  and  government  investigations,  other  proceedings,  and  consent  orders  could  result  in adverse consequences.\n\nSignificant  judgment is required to determine both the likelihood, and the estimated amount, of a loss  related  to  such  matters.  Auditing  management's  accounting  for  and  disclosure  of  loss contingencies from these matters involved challenging and subjective auditor judgment in assessing the Company's evaluation of the probability of a loss, and the estimated amount or range of loss.\n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n\nWe tested relevant controls over the identified risks associated with management's accounting for and  disclosure  of  these  matters.  This  included  controls  over  management's  assessment  of  the probability of incurrence of a loss and whether the loss or range of loss was reasonably estimable and the development of related disclosures.\n\nOur audit  procedures  included  gaining  an  understanding  of  previous  rulings  issued  by  regulators and  the  status  of  ongoing  lawsuits,  reviewing  letters  addressing  the  matters  from  internal  and external legal counsel, meeting with internal legal counsel to discuss the allegations, and obtaining a representation  letter  from  management  on  these  matters.  We  also  evaluated  the  Company's disclosures in relation to these matters.\n\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1999.\n\nSan Jose, California February 2, 2023\n\n45\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Alphabet Inc.\n\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited Alphabet Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Alphabet Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2022 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated February 2, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the  accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the  PCAOB and are required  to  be  independent  with  respect  to  the  Company  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.  federal securities  laws  and  the  applicable  rules  and  regulations  of  the  U.S.  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  and  the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur  audit  included  obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management  and  directors  of  the  company;  and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\n\nSan Jose, California February 2, 2023\n\n46\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nAlphabet Inc.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nNature of Operations\n\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\n\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscriptionbased products.\n\nBasis of Consolidation\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  of  Alphabet  include  the  accounts  of  Alphabet  and  entities  consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nPreparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  GAAP  requires  us  to  make  estimates  and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates,  including  those  related  to  the  allowance  for  credit  losses;  fair  values  of  financial  instruments,  intangible assets,  and  goodwill;  inventory;  useful  lives  of  intangible  assets  and  property  and  equipment;  income  taxes;  and contingent liabilities, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable, and the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\n\nIn  January  2023,  we  completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and adjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain network equipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate is effective beginning in fiscal year 2023.\n\nStock Split Effected in the Form of a Stock Dividend ('Stock Split')\n\nOn February 1, 2022, the company announced that the Board of Directors had approved and declared a 20-forone stock split in the form of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the company's Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. The Stock Split had a record date of July 1, 2022 and an effective date of July 15, 2022. The par value per share of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock remains unchanged at $0.001 per share after the Stock Split. All prior period references made to share or per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and applicable disclosures prior to the effective date have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock Split.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, and the collectibility  of  an  amount  that  we  expect  in  exchange  for  those  goods  or  services  is  probable.  Sales  and  other similar taxes are excluded from revenues.\n\nAdvertising Revenues\n\nWe generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on:\n\nGoogle Search and other properties, including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n\nYouTube properties; and\n\nGoogle  Network  properties,  including  revenues  from  Google  Network  properties  participating  in  AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\n\nOur customers generally purchase advertising inventory through Google Ads, Google Ad Manager, and Google Marketing Platform, among others.\n\n52\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nWe  offer  advertising  by  delivering  both  performance  and  brand  advertising.  We  recognize  revenues  for performance advertising when a user engages with the advertisement, such as a click, a view, or a purchase. For brand advertising, we recognize revenues when the ad is displayed, or a user views the ad.\n\nFor ads placed on Google Network properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed on Google Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues, and  amounts  paid  to  Google  Network  partners  are  recorded  as  cost  of  revenues.  Where  we  are  the  principal,  we control the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize  the  advertising  inventory  before  it  is  transferred  to  our  customers  and  is  further  supported  by  us  being primarily responsible to our customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing.\n\nGoogle Cloud Revenues\n\nGoogle Cloud revenues consist of revenues from:\n\nGoogle Cloud Platform, which includes fees for infrastructure, platform, and other services;\n\nGoogle Workspace, which includes fees for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for enterprises, such as Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar, and Meet; and\n\nother enterprise services.\n\nOur cloud services are generally provided on either a consumption or subscription basis and may have contract terms longer than a year. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis are recognized when the customer utilizes the services, based on the quantity of services consumed. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis are recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the cloud services.\n\nGoogle Other Revenues\n\nGoogle other revenues consist of revenues from:\n\nGoogle Play, which includes sales of apps and in-app purchases;\n\nhardware, which includes sales of Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, and Pixel devices;\n\nYouTube non-advertising, which includes subscription revenues from services such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV; and\n\nother products and services.\n\nWe report revenues from Google Play app sales and in-app purchases on a net basis, because our performance obligation is to facilitate a transaction between app developers and end users, for which we earn a service fee.\n\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\n\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate revenues  to  each  performance  obligation  based  on  its  relative  standalone  selling  price.  We  generally  determine standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers.\n\nCustomer Incentives and Credits\n\nCertain customers receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration.\n\nSales Commissions\n\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred when the amortization period (the period of the expected benefit) is one year or less. We recognize an asset for certain sales commissions if we expect the period of benefit of these costs to exceed one year and recognize the expense over the amortization period. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses.\n\nCost of Revenues\n\nCost of revenues consists of TAC and other costs of revenues.\n\nTAC includes:\n\n53\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nAmounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers.\n\nAmounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n\nOther cost of revenues includes:\n\nContent acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other  content  for  distribution  on  YouTube  and  Google  Play  (we  pay  fees  to  these  content  providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee).\n\nExpenses associated with our data centers (including bandwidth, compensation expenses, depreciation, energy, and other equipment costs) as well as other operations costs (such as content review as well as customer and product support costs).\n\nInventory and other costs related to the hardware we sell.\n\nSoftware Development Costs\n\nWe  expense  software  development  costs,  including  costs  to  develop  software  products  or  the  software component of products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, before technological feasibility is reached. Technological feasibility is typically reached shortly before the release of such products. As a result, development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented.\n\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and cloud-based  applications  used  to  deliver  our  services.  We  capitalize  development  costs  related  to  these  software applications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Costs capitalized for developing such software applications were not material for the periods presented.\n\nStock-based Compensation\n\nStock-based  compensation  primarily  consists  of  Alphabet  restricted  stock  units  (RSUs).  RSUs  are  equity classified and measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. We recognize RSU expense using the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur.\n\nFor RSUs, shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory income tax withholding to be paid by us on behalf of our employees. As a result, fewer shares are issued than the number of RSUs outstanding, and the income tax withholding is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.\n\nAdditionally,  stock-based  compensation  includes  other  stock-based  awards,  such  as  performance  stock  units (PSUs) that include market conditions and awards that may be settled in cash or the stock of certain Other Bets. PSUs and certain Other Bet awards are equity classified and expense is recognized over the requisite service period. Certain Other Bet awards are liability classified and remeasured at fair value through settlement. The fair value of Other Bet awards is based on the equity valuation of the respective Other Bet.\n\nAdvertising and Promotional Expenses\n\nWe expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $5.4 billion, $7.9 billion, and $9.2 billion, respectively.\n\nPerformance Fees\n\nPerformance  fees  refer  to  compensation  arrangements  with  payouts  based  on  realized  returns  from  certain investments. We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may result in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use of unobservable inputs. Performance fees are recorded as a component of other income (expense), net.\n\nFair Value Measurements\n\nFair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. Assets and\n\n54\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nliabilities recorded at fair value are measured and classified in accordance with a three-tier fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the inputs available in the market used to measure fair value:\n\nLevel  1  -  Observable  inputs  that  reflect  quoted  prices  (unadjusted)  for  identical  assets  or  liabilities  in  active markets.\n\nLevel 2 - Inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings.\n\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities.\n\nThe fair  value  hierarchy  requires  an  entity  to  maximize  the  use  of  observable  inputs  and  minimize  the  use  of unobservable  inputs  when  measuring  fair  value.  The  determination  of  fair  value  involves  the  use  of  appropriate valuation methods and relevant inputs into valuation models.\n\nOur financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivative financial instruments, and certain non-marketable debt securities. Our financial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include non-marketable equity securities. Other financial assets and liabilities are carried at cost with fair value disclosed, if required.\n\nWe measure certain other instruments, including stock-based compensation awards settled in the stock of certain Other Bets, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, also at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.\n\nFinancial Instruments\n\nOur financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents, marketable and non-marketable securities, derivative financial instruments and accounts receivable.\n\nCredit Risks\n\nWe  are  subject  to  credit  risk  from  cash  equivalents,  marketable  securities,  derivative  financial  instruments, including  foreign  exchange  contracts,  and  accounts  receivable.  We  manage  our  credit  risk  exposure  through  timely assessment of our counterparty creditworthiness, credit limits and use of collateral management. Foreign exchange contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the world. We manage our credit risk exposure by performing ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the amount of credit we extend. We generally do not require collateral from our customers.\n\nCash Equivalents\n\nWe invest excess cash primarily in government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and assetbacked securities, time deposits, and money market funds.\n\nMarketable Securities\n\nWe classify all marketable debt securities that have effective maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase as cash equivalents and those with effective maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. We have classified and accounted for our marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. After consideration of our risk versus reward objectives, as well as our liquidity requirements, we may sell these debt securities prior to their effective maturities. As we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify highly liquid securities with maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We carry  these  securities  at  fair  value,  and  report  the  unrealized  gains  and  losses,  net  of  taxes,  as  a  component  of stockholders'  equity,  except  for  the  changes  in  allowance  for  expected  credit  losses,  which  are  recorded  in  other income (expense), net. For certain marketable debt securities we have elected the fair value option, for which changes in fair value are recorded in other income (expense), net. We determine any realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable debt securities on a specific identification method, and we record such gains and losses as a component of other income (expense), net.\n\nOur investments  in  marketable  equity  securities  are  measured  at  fair  value  with  the  related  gains  and  losses, including unrealized, recognized in other income (expense), net. We classify our marketable equity securities subject\n\n55\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nto  long-term  lock-up  restrictions  beyond  twelve  months  as  other  non-current  assets  on  the  Consolidated  Balance Sheets.\n\nNon-Marketable Securities\n\nWe account for non-marketable equity securities through which we exercise significant influence but do not have control over the investee under the equity method, All other non-marketable equity securities that we hold are primarily accounted for under the measurement alternative. Under the measurement alternative, the carrying value is measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Adjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date and are recorded as a component of other income (expense), net.\n\nNon-marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.\n\nNon-marketable securities that do not have effective contractual maturity dates are classified as other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments\n\nSee Note 3 for the accounting policy pertaining to derivative financial instruments.\n\nAccounts Receivable\n\nOur payment terms for accounts receivable vary by the types and locations of our customers and the products or services  offered.  The  term  between  invoicing  and  when  payment  is  due  is  not  significant.  For  certain  products  or services  and  customers,  we  require  payment  before  the  products  or  services  are  delivered  to  the  customer. Additionally,  accounts  receivable  includes  amounts  for  services  performed  in  advance  of  the  right  to  invoice  the customer.\n\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable, which is recorded as an offset to accounts receivable, and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We assess collectibility by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics exist  and  on  an  individual  basis  when  we  identify  specific  customers  with  known  disputes  or  collectibility  issues.  In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we consider historical collectibility based on past due status and make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also consider customer-specific information, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions.\n\nOther\n\nOur  financial  instruments  also  include  debt  and  equity  investments  in  companies  with  which  we  also  have commercial arrangements. For these transactions, judgment is required to assess the substance of the arrangements, whether the arrangements and each component of the arrangements should be accounted for as separate transactions under the applicable GAAP, as well as the determination of the value of the components of the arrangements, including the fair value of the investments.\n\nImpairment of Investments\n\nWe periodically review our debt and non-marketable equity securities for impairment.\n\nFor debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists. The credit loss is estimated by considering available information relevant to the collectibility of the security and information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Any credit loss is recorded as a charge to other income (expense), net, not to exceed the amount of the unrealized loss. Unrealized losses other than the credit loss are recognized in AOCI. If we have an intent to sell, or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a debt security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis, we will write down the security to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as a component of other income (expense), net.\n\nFor  non-marketable  equity  securities,  including  equity  method  investments,  we  consider  whether  impairment indicators exist by evaluating the companies' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among other indicators. If the assessment indicates that the investment is impaired, we write down the investment to its fair value by recording the corresponding charge as a component of other income (expense), net. We prepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income approach.\n\n56\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nInventory\n\nInventory consists primarily of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is computed using the first-in, first-out method.\n\nVariable Interest Entities\n\nWe determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in which we have other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity (VIE). We consolidate VIEs when we are the primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have the power to direct activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses or benefits. If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.\n\nPeriodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination of whether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary.\n\nProperty and Equipment\n\nProperty  and  equipment  includes  the  following  categories:  land  and  buildings,  information  technology  assets, construction in progress, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures. Land and buildings include land, offices, data  centers,  and  related  building  improvements.  Information  technology  assets  include  servers  and  network equipment. Construction in progress is the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service.\n\nWe account for property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation. We compute depreciation using the  straight-line  method  over  the  estimated  useful  lives  of  the  assets,  which  we  regularly  evaluate.  Land  is  not depreciated. We depreciate buildings over periods of seven to 25 years. We depreciate information technology assets generally over periods of four to five years (generally, four years for servers and five years for network equipment). We depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation for buildings, information technology assets, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures commences once they are ready for our intended use.\n\nLeases\n\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our lease agreements generally contain lease and nonlease  components.  Payments  under  our  lease  arrangements  are  primarily  fixed.  Non-lease  components  primarily include  payments  for  maintenance  and  utilities.  We  combine  fixed  payments  for  non-lease  components  with  lease payments and account for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets and liabilities.\n\nCertain  lease  agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the lease  assets  and  liabilities.  These  amounts  include  payments  affected  by  the  Consumer  Price  Index,  payments contingent on wind or solar production for power purchase arrangements, and payments for maintenance and utilities.\n\nLease  assets  and  liabilities  are  recognized  at  the  present  value  of  the  future  lease  payments  at  the  lease commencement  date.  The  interest  rate  used  to  determine  the  present  value  of  the  future  lease  payments  is  our incremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit in our leases is not readily determinable. Our incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, and in economic environments where the leased asset is located. Our lease terms include periods under options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally use the base, non-cancelable, lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities. Lease assets also include any prepaid lease payments and lease incentives.\n\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The current portion of our operating  lease  liabilities  is  included  in  accrued  expenses  and  other  current  liabilities,  and  the  long-term  portion  is included in operating lease liabilities. Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment, net. Finance lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or long-term debt.\n\nOperating lease expense (excluding variable lease costs) is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nLong-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets\n\nWe review  property  and  equipment  and  intangible  assets,  excluding  goodwill,  for  impairment  when  events  or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. We measure recoverability of these assets by\n\n57\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\ncomparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to  generate.  If  the  carrying  value  of  the  assets  or  asset  group  is  not  recoverable,  the  impairment  recognized  is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Impairments were not material for the periods presented.\n\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units periodically, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in reporting units, we reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. We test our goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Goodwill impairments were not material for the periods presented.\n\nIntangible  assets  with  definite  lives  are  amortized  over  their  estimated  useful  lives  on  a  straight-line  basis generally over periods ranging from one to twelve years, and are subsequently removed from the presentation of gross intangible assets and accumulated amortization once they are fully amortized.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which we recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that  have  been  recognized  in  our  financial  statements  or  tax  returns.  We  measure  current  and  deferred  tax assets and liabilities based on provisions of enacted tax law. We evaluate the realization of our deferred tax assets based on all available evidence and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. We have elected to account for the tax effects of the global intangible low tax Income provision as a current period expense.\n\nWe recognize  the  financial  statement  effects  of  a  tax  position  when  it  is  more  likely  than  not  that,  based  on technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The tax benefits of the position recognized in the financial statements are then measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized  upon  settlement  with  a  taxing  authority.  In  addition,  we  recognize  interest  and  penalties  related  to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision.\n\nBusiness Combinations\n\nWe include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the acquisition date. We allocate the purchase price of the acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, except for revenue contracts acquired, which are recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The excess  of  the  purchase  price  over  the  fair  values  of  identifiable  assets  and  liabilities  is  recorded  as  goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.\n\nForeign Currency\n\nWe translate the financial statements of our international subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange rates  for  assets  and  liabilities,  and  average  rates  for  the  annual  period  derived  from  month-end  exchange  rates  for revenues,  costs,  and  expenses.  We  record  translation  gains  and  losses  in  AOCI  as  a  component  of  stockholders' equity. We reflect net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction currency to functional currency as a component of foreign currency exchange gain (loss) in other income (expense), net.\n\nPrior Period Reclassifications\n\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.\n\n58\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nNote 2. Revenues\n\nDisaggregated Revenues\n\nThe following table presents revenues disaggregated by type (in millions):\n\nNo individual customer or groups of affiliated customers represented more than 10% of our revenues in 2020, 2021, or 2022.\n\nThe following table presents revenues disaggregated by geography, based on the addresses of our customers (in millions):\n\nRegions represent Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); Asia-Pacific (APAC); and Canada and Latin America (\"Other Americas\"). (1)\n\nRevenue Backlog\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2022,  we  had  $64.3  billion  of  remaining  performance  obligations  ('revenue  backlog'), primarily  related  to  Google  Cloud.  Our  revenue  backlog  represents  commitments  in  customer  contracts  for  future services  that  have  not  yet  been  recognized  as  revenue.  The  amount  and  timing  of  revenue  recognition  for  these commitments  is  largely  driven  by  our  ability  to  deliver  in  accordance  with  relevant  contract  terms  and  when  our customers utilize services, which could affect our estimate of revenue backlog and when we expect to recognize such as revenue. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.\n\nDeferred Revenue\n\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other. Total deferred revenue as of  December 31, 2021 was $3.8 billion,  of  which  $2.5  billion  was  recognized  as  revenues  for  the  year ending December 31, 2022.\n\n59\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nNote 3. Financial Instruments\n\nFair Value Measurements\n\nInvestments measured at fair value on a recurring basis\n\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable equity securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 1 and Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets or inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets.\n\nDebt securities are classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine fair value. For  certain  marketable  debt  securities,  we  have  elected  the  fair  value  option  for  which  changes  in  fair  value  are recorded  in  other  income  (expense),  net.  The  fair  value  option  was  elected  for  these  securities  to  align  with  the unrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts.\n\nThe following tables summarize our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in millions):\n\nThe majority of our time deposits are domestic deposits. (1)\n\nRepresents gross unrealized gains and losses for debt securities recorded to AOCI. (2)\n\nThe  long-term  portion  of  marketable  equity  securities  (subject  to  long-term  lock-up  restrictions)  of  $1.4  billion  as  of December 31, 2021 is included within other non-current assets. (3)\n\n60\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nThe majority of our time deposits are domestic deposits. (1)\n\nRepresents gross unrealized gains and losses for debt securities recorded to AOCI. (2)\n\nThe  long-term  portion  of  marketable  equity  securities  (subject  to  long-term  lock-up  restrictions)  of  $803  million  as  of December 31, 2022 is included within other non-current assets. (3)\n\nInvestments measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis\n\nOur non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the value based on valuation methods which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. The fair value of non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment are classified within Level 3.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, included in the $28.5 billion of non-marketable equity securities held as of the end of the period, $14.1 billion were measured at fair value and primarily classified as Level 2 investments.\n\n61\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nDebt Securities\n\nThe following  table  summarizes  the  estimated  fair  value  of  investments  in  available-for-sale  marketable  debt securities by effective contractual maturity dates (in millions):\n\nThe following tables present fair values and gross unrealized losses recorded to AOCI, aggregated by investment category and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position (in millions):\n\nWe determine realized gains or losses on the sale or extinguishment of debt securities on a specific identification method.The  following  table  summarizes  gains  and  losses  for  debt  securities,  reflected  as  a  component  of  other income (expense), net (in millions):\n\nAccumulated unrealized net gains (losses) related to debt securities still held where we have elected the fair value option were $87 million, $(35) million, and $(592) million as of December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively. (1)\n\n62\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nEquity Investments\n\nThe carrying value of equity securities is measured as the total initial cost plus the cumulative net gain (loss). Our share of gains and losses, including impairments, are included as a component of other income (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 7 for further details on other income (expense), net.\n\nThe carrying values for marketable and non-marketable equity securities are summarized below (in millions):\n\nNon-marketable equity securities cumulative net gain (loss) is comprised of $14.1 billion gains and $1.7 billion losses (including impairments)  as  of  December  31,  2021  and  $16.8  billion  gains  and  $4.5  billion  losses  (including  impairments)  as  of December 31, 2022. (1)\n\nGains and losses on marketable and non-marketable equity securities\n\nGains and losses (including impairments), net, for marketable and non-marketable equity securities included in other income (expense), net are summarized below (in millions):\n\nUnrealized gain (loss) on non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the measurement alternative is comprised of $3.0 billion, $10.0 billion, and $3.3 billion of upward adjustments as of December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively, and $1.5 billion, $122 million, and $3.0 billion of downward adjustments (including impairments) as of December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively. (1)\n\nIn  the  table  above,  realized  net  gain  (loss)  on  equity  securities  sold  during  the  period  reflects  the  difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying value of the equity securities at the beginning of the period or the purchase date, if later.\n\nCumulative net gains (losses) on equity securities sold during the period, which is summarized in the following table (in millions), represents the total net gains (losses) recognized after the initial purchase date of the equity security sold during the period. While these net gains (losses) may have been reflected in periods prior to the period of sale, we believe they are important supplemental information as they reflect the economic net gains (losses) on the securities sold during the period. Cumulative net gains (losses) are calculated as the difference between the sale price and the initial purchase price for the equity security sold during the period.\n\nCumulative  net  gains  excludes  cumulative  losses  of  $738  million  resulting  from  our  equity  derivatives,  which  hedged  the changes in fair value of certain marketable equity securities sold during the year ended December 31, 2021. The associated derivative liabilities arising from these losses were settled against our holdings of the underlying equity securities. (1)\n\n63\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nEquity securities accounted for under the equity method\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2022, equity securities accounted for under the equity method had a carrying value of approximately $1.5 billion for both years. Our share of gains and losses, including impairments, are included as a component of other income (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 7 for further details on other income (expense), net.\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments\n\nWe use derivative  instruments  to  manage  risks  relating  to  our  ongoing  business  operations.  The  primary  risk managed is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance investment returns.\n\nWe recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the derivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at gross fair values. The accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation.\n\nCash Flow Hedges\n\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including  collars)  as  cash  flow  hedges  to  hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have maturities of 24 months or less.\n\nCash  flow  hedge  amounts  included  in  the  assessment  of  hedge  effectiveness  are  deferred  in  AOCI  and subsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points and time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging  instrument  in  revenues.  The  difference  between  fair  value  changes  of  the  excluded  component  and  the amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect was $171 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months.\n\nFair Value Hedges\n\nWe designate  foreign  currency  forward  contracts  as  fair  value  hedges  to  hedge  foreign  currency  risks  for  our marketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net, along with the offsetting gains and losses  of  the  related  hedged  items.  We  exclude  forward  points  from  the  assessment  of  hedge  effectiveness  and recognize changes in the excluded component in other income (expense), net.\n\nNet Investment Hedges\n\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude forward points from  the  assessment  of  hedge  effectiveness  and  recognize  changes  in  the  excluded  component  in  other  income (expense), net.\n\nOther Derivatives\n\nWe enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to hedge intercompany transactions  and  other  monetary  assets  or  liabilities  denominated  in  currencies  other  than  the functional  currency  of  a  subsidiary.  Gains  and  losses  on  these  derivatives  that  are  not  designated  as  accounting hedges are primarily  recorded  in  other  income  (expense),  net  along  with  the  foreign  currency  gains  and  losses  on monetary assets and liabilities.\n\nWe  also  use  derivatives  not  designated  as  hedging  instruments  to  manage  risks  relating  to  interest  rates, commodity prices, credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns. From time to time, we enter into derivatives to hedge  the  market  price  risk  on  certain  of  our  marketable  equity  securities.  Gains  and  losses  arising  from  other derivatives are primarily reflected within the 'other' component of other income (expense), net. See Note 7 for further details.\n\n64\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nThe gross notional amounts of outstanding derivative instruments were as follows (in millions):\n\nThe fair values of outstanding derivative instruments were as follows (in millions):\n\nDerivative assets are recorded as other current and non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

These  leases  will  commence  between  2023  and  2026  with  non-cancelable  lease  terms  between  1  and  25 years.\n\nNote 5. Variable Interest Entities\n\nConsolidated VIEs\n\nWe consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements.\n\nFor certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us and their creditors do not have recourse to us. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $6.0 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs were $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. We may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs that are included within Other Bets.\n\nTotal  noncontrolling  interests  (NCI)  in  our  consolidated  subsidiaries  were  $4.3  billion  and  $3.8  billion  as  of December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively, of which $1.1 billion is redeemable noncontrolling interest (RNCI) for both periods. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was not material for any period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of OI&E. See Note 7 for further details on OI&E.\n\nUnconsolidated VIEs\n\nWe have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private companies that  are  primarily  early  stage  companies  and  certain  renewable  energy  entities  in  which  activities  involve  power generation using renewable sources.\n\nWe have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that would significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We account for these investments as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments.\n\nThe maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the investments and any future funding commitments. We have determined that the single source of our exposure to these VIEs is our capital investments in them. The carrying value and maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs were $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2021 and $2.7 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2022.\n\nNote 6. Debt\n\nShort-Term Debt\n\nWe have a debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from  this  program  are  used  for  general  corporate  purposes.  We  had  no  commercial  paper  outstanding  as  of December 31, 2021 and 2022.\n\nOur short-term debt balance also includes the current portion of certain long-term debt.\n\n68\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nLong-Term Debt\n\nTotal outstanding debt is summarized below (in millions, except percentages):\n\nFuture finance lease payments are net of imputed interest. (1)\n\nTotal current portion of long-term debt is included within other accrued expenses and current liabilities. See Note 7 for further details. (2)\n\nThe notes in the table above are fixed-rate senior unsecured obligations and generally rank equally with each other. We may redeem the notes at any time in whole or in part at specified redemption prices. The effective interest rates are based on proceeds received with interest payable semi-annually.\n\nThe  total  estimated  fair  value  of  the  outstanding  notes  was  approximately  $12.4  billion  and  $9.9  billion  as  of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The fair value was determined based on observable market prices  of  identical  instruments  in  less  active  markets  and  is  categorized  accordingly  as  Level  2  in  the  fair  value hierarchy.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the aggregate future principal payments for long-term debt, including finance lease liabilities, for each of the next five years and thereafter were as follows (in millions):\n\nCredit Facility\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, $4.0 billion expiring in April 2023 and $6.0 billion expiring in April 2026. The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using certain market rates, as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals. No amounts were outstanding under the credit facilities as of December 31, 2021 and 2022.\n\nNote 7. Supplemental Financial Statement Information\n\nAccounts Receivable\n\nThe allowance for credit losses on accounts receivable was $550 million and $754 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively.\n\n69\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nProperty and Equipment, Net\n\nProperty and equipment, net, consisted of the following (in millions):\n\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\n\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities consisted of the following (in millions):\n\nWhile  each  EC  decision  is  under  appeal,  the  fines  are  included  in  accrued  expenses  and  other  current  liabilities  on  our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines. Amounts include the effects of foreign exchange and interest. See Note 10 for further details.

(1)\n\nNote 8. Acquisitions\n\nMandiant Acquisition\n\nOn  September  12,  2022  we  closed  the  acquisition  of  Mandiant  for  a  total  purchase  price  of  $6.1  billion, including  cash  and  debt.  The  purchase  price  excludes  post  acquisition  compensation  arrangements.  Mandiant's dynamic cyber defense, threat intelligence and incident response services are expected to enhance Google Cloud's security offerings. The financial results of Mandiant have been included within the Google Cloud segment as of the close of the acquisition.\n\nThe purchase price was allocated as follows (in millions):\n\nGoodwill  was  recorded  in  the  Google  Cloud  segment  and  primarily  attributable  to  synergies  expected  to  arise  after  the acquisition. Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. (1)\n\nIncludes $706 million of acquired cash. (2)\n\nIntangible assets acquired as of the acquisition date were as follows:\n\n72\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nNote 9. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill\n\nChanges in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022 were as follows (in millions):\n\nOther Intangible Assets\n\nInformation regarding intangible assets was as follows (in millions):\n\nFor  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022,  $4.5  billion  of  intangible  assets  that  were  fully  amortized  have  been removed from gross intangible assets and accumulated amortization.\n\nAmortization expense relating to intangible assets was $774 million, $875 million, and $642 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively.\n\nExpected amortization expense of definite-lived intangible assets held as of December 31, 2022 was as follows (in millions):\n\nNote 10. Commitments and contingencies\n\nCommitments\n\nWe have content licensing agreements with future fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments of $12.3 billion as of December 31, 2022, of which the majority will be paid over seven years commencing in 2023.\n\n73\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nIndemnifications\n\nIn the normal course of business, including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate activities, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network partners, distribution partners, customers of  Google  Cloud  offerings,  lessors,  and  service  providers  with  respect  to  certain  matters.  We  have  agreed  to  hold certain  parties  harmless  against  losses  arising  from  a  breach  of  representations  or  covenants,  or  out  of  intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which  an  indemnification  claim  can  be  made  and  the  amount  of  the  claim.  In  addition,  we  have  entered  into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.\n\nIt  is  not  possible  to  make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements  due  to  the  unique  facts  and  circumstances  involved  in  each  particular  agreement.  Additionally,  the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash  flows,  or  financial  position.  However,  to  the  extent  that  valid  indemnification  claims  arise  in  the  future,  future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible.\n\nLegal Matters\n\nWe record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably  estimated.  If  we  determine  that  a  loss  is  reasonably  possible  and  the  loss  or  range  of  loss  can  be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the  amount  of  liability  that  has  been  previously  accrued,  and  the  matters  and  related  reasonably  possible  losses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.\n\nCertain  outstanding  matters  include  speculative,  substantial  or  indeterminate  monetary  amounts.  Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and we may be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of outstanding  legal  matters  are  inherently  unpredictable  and  subject  to  significant  uncertainties,  and  could,  either individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect.\n\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\n\nAntitrust Investigations\n\nOn  November  30,  2010,  the  EC's  Directorate  General  for  Competition  opened  an  investigation  into  various antitrust-related complaints against us.\n\nOn June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display and ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC decision to the General Court, and on  September  27,  2017,  we  implemented  product  changes  to  bring  shopping  ads  into  compliance  with  the  EC's decision. We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2017. On November 10, 2021, the General Court rejected our appeal, and we subsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice on January 20, 2022.\n\nOn July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google's Android-related distribution agreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, we appealed the EC decision, and on  October  29,  2018,  we  implemented  changes  to  certain  of  our  Android  distribution  practices.  On  September  14, 2022, the General Court reduced the fine from €4.3 billion to €4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal with the European  Court  of  Justice.  In  2018,  we  recognized  a  charge  of  $5.1  billion  for  the  fine,  which  we  reduced  by $217 million in 2022.\n\nOn March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that Google had with AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a fine of €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners' agreements, which we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed the EC decision, which remains pending. We recognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019.\n\nFrom  time  to  time  we  are  subject  to  formal  and  informal  inquiries  and  investigations  on  various  competition matters by regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally. For example:\n\n74\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nIn  August  2019,  we  began receiving civil  investigative  demands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) requesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our business. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit on October 20, 2020 alleging that Google  violated  U.S.  antitrust  laws  relating  to  Search  and  Search  advertising.  Further,  in  June  2022,  the Australian  Competition  and  Consumer  Commission  (ACCC)  and  the  United  Kingdom's  Competition  and Markets Authority (CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.\n\nOn December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court  for  the  Eastern  District  of  Texas,  alleging  that  Google  violated  U.S.  antitrust  laws  as  well  as  state deceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology. Additionally, on January 24, 2023, the DOJ, along with a number of state Attorneys General, filed an antitrust complaint alleging that Google's digital advertising technology  products  violate  U.S.  antitrust  laws.  The  EC,  the  CMA,  and  the  ACCC  each  opened  a  formal investigation  into  Google's  advertising  technology  business  practices  on  June  22,  2021,  May  25,  2022,  and June 29, 2022, respectively.\n\nOn July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that Google's operation of Android and Google Play violated U.S. antitrust  laws  and  state  antitrust  and  consumer  protection  laws.  In  May  2022,  the  EC  and  the  CMA  each opened investigations into Google Play's business practices. Korean regulators are investigating Google Play's billing practices, most recently opening a formal review in May 2022 of Google's compliance with the new app store billing regulations.\n\nWe believe these complaints are without merit and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue to cooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\n\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\n\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in these lawsuits  may  include  awards  of  substantial  monetary  damages,  costly  royalty  or  licensing  agreements,  or  orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us  and  otherwise  harm  our  business.  In  addition,  the  U.S.  International  Trade  Commission  (ITC)  has  increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\n\nFurthermore,  many  of  our  agreements  with  our  customers  and  partners  require  us  to  indemnify  them  against certain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\n\nOther\n\nWe are subject  to  claims,  lawsuits,  regulatory  and  government  investigations,  other  proceedings,  and  consent orders  involving  competition,  intellectual  property,  data  privacy  and  security,  tax  and  related  compliance,  labor  and employment,  commercial  disputes,  content  generated  by  our  users,  goods  and  services  offered  by  advertisers  or publishers  using  our  platforms,  personal  injury,  consumer  protection,  and  other  matters.  For  example,  we  currently have a number of privacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. We also periodically have data incidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. Such claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders could result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models and  operations,  and  collateral  related  civil  litigation  or  other  adverse  consequences,  all  of  which  could  harm  our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nWe  have  ongoing  legal  matters  relating  to  Russia.  For  example,  civil  judgments  that  include  compounding penalties  have  been  imposed  upon  us  in  connection  with  disputes  regarding  the  termination  of  accounts,  including those of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.\n\n75\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nNon-Income Taxes\n\nWe are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. The subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We accrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these  matters  and  judicial  process  in  certain  jurisdictions,  the  final  outcome  may  be  materially  different  from  our expectations.\n\nFor information regarding income tax contingencies see Note 14.\n\nNote 11. Stockholders' Equity\n\nClass A and Class B Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock\n\nOur Board of Directors has authorized three classes of stock, Class A and Class B common stock, and Class C capital stock. The rights of the holders of each class of our common and capital stock are identical, except with respect to voting. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock is  entitled  to  10  votes  per  share.  Class  C  capital  stock  has  no  voting  rights,  except  as  required  by  applicable  law. Shares of Class B common stock may be converted at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically convert upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock.\n\nStock Split\n\nOn July 15, 2022, the company executed a 20-for-one stock split with a record date of July 1, 2022, effected in the form of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the company's Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. All prior period references made to share or per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and applicable disclosures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock Split. See Note 1 for further details.\n\nShare Repurchases\n\nIn April 2022, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares. As of December 31, 2022, $28.1 billion remains available for Class A and Class C share repurchases.\n\nThe following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):\n\nClass A and Class C shares are repurchased in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its stockholders,  taking  into  account  the  economic  cost  and  prevailing  market  conditions,  including  the  relative  trading prices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. Repurchases are executed from time to time, subject to general business  and  market  conditions  and  other  investment  opportunities,  through  open  market  purchases  or  privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date.\n\nNote 12. Net Income Per Share\n\nWe compute net income per share of Class A, Class B, and Class C stock using the two-class method. Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income  per  share  is  computed  using  the  weighted-average  number  of  shares  and  the  effect  of  potentially  dilutive securities  outstanding  during  the  period.  Potentially  dilutive  securities  consist  of  restricted  stock  units  and  other contingently issuable shares. The dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A stock assumes the conversion of Class B stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B stock does not assume the conversion of those shares.\n\n76\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nThe rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock are identical, except with respect to voting. Furthermore, there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of incorporation, as well as Delaware law, which preclude our Board of Directors from declaring or paying unequal per share dividends on our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. Specifically, Delaware law provides that amendments to our certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a given  class  of  stock  must  be  approved  by  the  class  of  stock  adversely  affected  by  the  proposed  amendment.  In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder vote, it must be approved by the unanimous consent of our Board of Directors. As a result, the undistributed earnings for each year are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A, Class B, and Class C stock as if the earnings  for  the  year  had  been  distributed.  As  the  liquidation  and  dividend  rights  are  identical,  the  undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis.\n\nIn the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022, the net income per share amounts are the same for Class A, Class B, and Class C stock because the holders of each class are entitled to equal per share dividends or distributions in liquidation in accordance with the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Alphabet Inc.\n\nThe following tables set forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share of Class A, Class B, and Class C stock (in millions, except per share amounts):\n\n77\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\n78\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nNote 13. Compensation Plans\n\nStock Plans\n\nOur stock plans include the Alphabet Amended and Restated 2021 Stock Plan (\"Alphabet 2021 Stock Plan\") and Other  Bet  stock-based  plans.  Under  our  stock  plans,  RSUs  and  other  types  of  awards  may  be  granted.  Under  the Alphabet 2021 Stock Plan, an RSU award is an agreement to issue shares of our Class C stock at the time the award vests. RSUs generally vest over four years contingent upon employment on the vesting date.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, there were 706 million shares of Class C stock reserved for future issuance under the Alphabet 2021 Stock Plan.\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022, total stock-based compensation expense was $13.4 billion, $15.7 billion, and $19.5 billion, including amounts associated with awards we expect to settle in Alphabet stock of $12.8 billion, $15.0 billion, and $18.8 billion, respectively.\n\nFor  the  years  ended  December  31,  2020,  2021,  and  2022,  we  recognized  tax  benefits  on  total  stock-based compensation  expense,  which  are  reflected  in  the  provision  for  income  taxes  in  the  Consolidated  Statements  of Income, of $2.7 billion, $3.1 billion, and $3.9 billion, respectively.\n\nFor  the  years  ended  December  31,  2020,  2021,  and  2022,  tax  benefit  realized  related  to  awards  vested  or exercised during the period was $3.6 billion, $5.9 billion, and $4.7 billion, respectively. These amounts do not include the indirect effects of stock-based awards, which primarily relate to the R&D tax credit.\n\nStock-Based Award Activities\n\nThe following table summarizes the activities for unvested Alphabet RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2022 (in millions, except per share amounts):\n\nThe weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021 was $70.40 and $97.46, respectively. Total fair value of RSUs, as of their respective vesting dates, during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022, were $17.8 billion, $28.8 billion, and $23.9 billion, respectively.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, there was $32.8 billion of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.6 years.\n\nNote 14. Income Taxes\n\nIncome from continuing operations before income taxes consisted of the following (in millions):\n\n79\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nProvision for income taxes consisted of the following (in millions):\n\nThe reconciliation of federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate was as follows:\n\nIn 2022, there was an increase in the U.S. Foreign Derived Intangible Income tax deduction from the effects of capitalization and amortization of R&D expenses in 2022 as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n\n80\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nDeferred Income Taxes\n\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows (in millions):\n\nAs required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, effective January 1, 2022, our research and development expenditures were capitalized  and  amortized  which  resulted  in  substantially  higher  cash  taxes  for  2022  with  an  equal  amount  of  deferred  tax benefit. (1)\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, our federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $6.4 billion, $14.6 billion, and $1.8 billion respectively. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2023, foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2025 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2028. It is more likely than not that the majority of the net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized; therefore, we have recorded a valuation allowance against them. The net  operating  loss  carryforwards  are  subject  to  various  annual  limitations  under  the  tax  laws  of  the  different jurisdictions.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, our Federal and California research and development credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $400 million and $5.8 billion, respectively. If not utilized, the Federal R&D credit will begin to expire in 2037 and the California R&D credit can be carried over indefinitely. We believe the majority of the federal tax credit and state tax credit is not likely to be realized.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2022,  our  investment  tax  credit  carryforwards  for  state  income  tax  purposes  were approximately  $931  million  and  will  begin  to  expire  in  2025.  We  use  the  flow-through  method  of  accounting  for investment tax credits. We believe this tax credit is not likely to be realized.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we maintained a valuation allowance with respect to California deferred tax assets, certain federal net operating losses, certain state net operating losses and tax credits, net deferred tax assets relating to certain Other Bets, and certain foreign net operating losses that we believe are not likely to be realized. We continue to reassess the remaining valuation allowance quarterly, and if future evidence allows for a partial or full release of the valuation allowance, a tax benefit will be recorded accordingly.\n\n81\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nUncertain Tax Positions\n\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to our gross unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $3.8 billion, $5.2 billion, and $7.1 billion as of December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively, of which $2.6 billion, $3.7 billion, and $5.3 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate, respectively.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2021  and  2022,  we  accrued  $270  million  and  $346  million  in  interest  and  penalties  in provision for income taxes, respectively.\n\nWe file  income  tax  returns  in  the  U.S.  federal  jurisdiction  and  in  many  state  and  foreign  jurisdictions.  Our  two major tax jurisdictions are the U.S. federal and Ireland. We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. The IRS is currently examining our 2016 through 2018 tax returns. We have also received tax assessments in multiple foreign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or permanent establishment. We continue to defend any and all such claims as presented.\n\nThe tax years 2015 through 2021 remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for Irish tax purposes. There are other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial statements.\n\nWe  regularly  assess  the  likelihood  of  adverse  outcomes  resulting  from  these  examinations  to  determine  the adequacy  of  our  provision  for  income  taxes.  We  continue  to  monitor  the  progress  of  ongoing  discussions  with  tax authorities and the effect, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions.\n\nWe believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolutions occur. Although the timing of resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is not certain, it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits from certain U.S. federal, state, and non U.S. tax  positions  could  decrease  by  approximately  $1.8  billion  in  the  next  12  months.  Positions  that  may  be  resolved include various U.S. and non-U.S. matters.\n\nNote 15. Information about Segments and Geographic Areas\n\nWe report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:\n\nGoogle  Services  includes  products  and  services  such  as  ads,  Android,  Chrome,  hardware,  Google  Maps, Google Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales of apps  and  in-app  purchases,  and  hardware;  and  fees  received  for  subscription-based  products  such  as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV.\n\nGoogle  Cloud  includes  infrastructure  and  platform  services,  collaboration  tools,  and  other  services  for enterprise  customers.  Google  Cloud  generates  revenues  from  fees  received  for  Google  Cloud  Platform services, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\n\nOther Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\n\nRevenues,  certain  costs,  such  as  costs  associated  with  content  and  traffic  acquisition,  certain  engineering activities, and hardware, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the integrated  nature  of  Alphabet,  other  costs  and  expenses,  such  as  technical  infrastructure  and  office  facilities,  are managed centrally at a consolidated level. The associated costs, including depreciation and impairment, are allocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage or headcount.\n\n82\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nUnallocated corporate costs primarily include corporate initiatives, corporate shared costs, such as finance and legal,  including  certain  fines  and  settlements,  as  well  as  costs  associated  with  certain  shared  R&D  activities. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are included in corporate costs.\n\nAs AI is critical to delivering our mission of bringing our breakthrough innovations into the real world, beginning in January 2023, we will update our segment reporting relating to certain of Alphabet's AI activities. DeepMind, previously reported within Other Bets, will be reported as part of Alphabet's corporate costs, reflecting its increasing collaboration with  Google  Services,  Google  Cloud,  and  Other  Bets.  Prior  periods  will  be  recast  to  conform  to  the  revised presentation.\n\nOur operating segments are not evaluated using asset information.\n\nThe following table presents information about our segments (in millions):\n\nFor revenues by geography see Note 2.\n\nThe following table presents long-lived assets by geographic area, which includes property and equipment, net and operating lease assets (in millions):\n\nNote 16. Subsequent Event\n\nIn January 2023, we announced a reduction of our workforce of approximately 12,000 roles. We expect to incur employee severance and related charges of $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion, the majority of which will be recognized in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nIn addition, we are taking actions to optimize our global office space. As a result we expect to incur exit costs relating to office space reductions of approximately $0.5 billion in the first quarter of 2023. We may incur additional charges in the future as we further evaluate our real estate needs.\n\n83\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\n\nNone.\n\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nOur  management,  with  the  participation  of  our  chief  executive  officer  and  chief  financial  officer,  evaluated  the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nBased on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on this evaluation, management  concluded  that  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  effective  as  of  December  31,  2022. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with our Audit and Compliance Committee. The effectiveness of our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  December  31,  2022  has  been  audited  by  Ernst  &  Young  LLP,  an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\n\nIn  designing  and  evaluating  the  disclosure  controls  and  procedures,  management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\n\nITEM 9B.

Washington\n\n91\n\nDESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES\n\nThe following summary of the rights of our Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock, Class C Capital Stock, and preferred stock (collectively, the 'Alphabet securities') does not purport to be complete. This summary is subject to and qualified by the provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation ('Certificate of Incorporation'), Amended and Restated Bylaws ('Bylaws'), the terms of our Class C Undertaking (as defined below), and certain Transfer Restriction Agreements (as defined below), copies of which are incorporated herein by reference. Additionally, the Delaware General Corporation Law ('DGCL'), as amended, also affects the terms of our capital stock.\n\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides for (1) the Class A Common Stock, which has one vote per share; (2) the Class B Common Stock, which has 10 votes per share; and (3) the Class C Capital Stock, which has no voting rights unless otherwise required by law. Our Certificate of Incorporation also provides for 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock.\n\nCapital Stock\n\nAuthorized Capital Stock\n\nOur authorized capital stock consists of 300,100,000,000 shares, each with a par value of $0.001 per share, of which:\n\n180,000,000,000 shares are designated as Class A Common Stock;\n\n60,000,000,000 shares are designated as Class B Common Stock;\n\n60,000,000,000 shares are designated as Class C Capital Stock; and\n\n100,000,000 shares are designated as preferred stock.\n\nVoting Rights\n\nHolders of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock have identical rights, except that holders of shares of Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of shares of Class B Common Stock are entitled to 10 votes per share. Holders of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock vote together as a single class on all matters (including the election of directors) submitted to a vote of stockholders, unless otherwise required by law.\n\nHolders of shares of Class C Capital Stock have no voting rights, unless otherwise required by law.\n\nThe DGCL could require the holders of any of the shares of Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock, or Class C Capital Stock to vote separately as a single class in the following circumstances:\n\nIf we amended our Certificate of Incorporation to increase or decrease the par value of the shares of a class of stock, then the holders of the shares of that class would be required to vote separately to approve the proposed amendment.\n\nExhibit 4.20\n\nIf we amended our Certificate of Incorporation in a manner that altered or changed the powers, preferences, or special rights of the shares of a class of stock so as to affect them adversely, then the holders of the shares of that class would be required to vote separately to approve the proposed amendment.\n\nAs permitted by the DGCL and as set forth in our Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock, and Class C Capital Stock do not have the right to vote separately as a single class if the number of authorized shares of such class is increased or decreased. Rather, the number of authorized shares of Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock, and Class C Capital Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, voting together as a single class.\n\nWe have not provided for cumulative voting for the election of directors.\n\nDividends\n\nSubject to preferences that may apply to any shares of preferred stock outstanding at the time, the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock, and Class C Capital Stock will be entitled to share equally, on a per share basis, in any dividends that our Board of Directors may determine to issue from time to time. In the event that a dividend is paid in the form of shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, or rights to acquire shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, (1) the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock shall receive Class A Common Stock, or rights to acquire shares of Class A Common Stock, as the case may be; (2) the holders of shares of Class B Common Stock shall receive shares of Class B Common Stock, or rights to acquire shares of Class B Common Stock, as the case may be; and (3) the holders of shares of Class C Capital Stock shall receive shares of Class C Capital Stock, or rights to acquire shares of Class C Capital Stock, as the case may be.\n\nLiquidation Rights\n\nUpon our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock shall be entitled to share equally in all assets remaining after the payment of any liabilities and the liquidation preferences on any outstanding preferred stock. Immediately prior to the earlier of (1) any distribution of our assets in connection with a liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up, or (2) any record date established to determine the holders of our capital stock entitled to receive such distribution, each share of Class C Capital Stock shall automatically be converted into one share of Class A Common Stock.\n\nConversion\n\nShares of Class A Common Stock are not convertible into any other shares of our capital stock.\n\nOther than in connection with a liquidation as described above, shares of Class C Capital Stock are not convertible into any other shares of our capital stock.\n\nEach share of Class B Common Stock is convertible at any time at the option of the holder into one share of Class A Common Stock upon written notice to our transfer agent. In addition, each share of Class B Common Stock shall convert automatically into one share of Class A Common Stock upon any transfer, whether or not for value, except for certain transfers described in our Certificate of Incorporation, including the following:\n\nTransfers between Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Google's co-founders, subject to the requirements of the Transfer Restriction Agreements, as amended (as described below).\n\nTransfers for tax and estate planning purposes, including to trusts, corporations, and partnerships established or controlled by a holder of Class B Common Stock.\n\nIn addition, partnerships or limited liability companies that held more than 5% of the total outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock as of the closing of Google's initial public offering in 2004 may distribute their shares of Class B Common Stock to their respective partners or members (who may further distribute the shares of Class B Common Stock to their respective partners or members) without triggering a conversion to shares of Class A Common Stock. Such distributions must be conducted in accordance with the ownership interests of such partners or members and the terms of any agreements binding the partnership or limited liability company.\n\nThe death of any holder of shares of Class B Common Stock who is a natural person will result in the conversion of his or her shares of Class B Common Stock, and any shares held by his or her permitted entities, into shares of Class A Common Stock. However, subject to the terms of the Transfer Restriction Agreements, either of Larry or Sergey may transfer voting control of his shares of Class B Common Stock and those held by his permitted entities to the other contingent or effective upon his death without triggering a conversion into shares of Class A Common Stock, but the shares of Class B Common Stock so transferred will convert to Class A Common Stock nine months after the death of the transferring founder.\n\nOnce transferred and converted into shares of Class A Common Stock, shares of Class B Common Stock shall not be reissued.\n\nNo class of our capital stock may be subdivided or combined unless the other classes of capital stock are concurrently subdivided or combined in the same proportion and in the same manner.\n\nEqual Status\n\nExcept as expressly provided in our Certificate of Incorporation, shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock have the same rights and privileges and rank equally, share ratably and are identical in all respects as to all matters. In the event of any merger, consolidation, or other business combination requiring the approval of our stockholders entitled to vote thereon (whether or not we are the surviving entity), the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock shall have the right to receive, or the right to elect to receive, the same form of consideration as the holders of shares of Class B Common Stock, and the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock shall have the right to receive, or the right to elect to receive, at least the same amount of consideration on a per share basis as the holders of shares of Class B Common Stock. In the event of any (1) tender or exchange offer to acquire any shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock by any third party pursuant to an agreement to which we are a party, or (2) any tender or exchange offer by us to acquire any shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock shall have the right to receive, or the right to elect to receive, the same form of consideration as the holders of shares of Class B Common Stock, and the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock shall have the right to receive, or the right to elect to receive, at least the same amount of consideration on a per share basis as the holders of shares of Class B Common Stock.\n\nExcept as expressly provided in our Certificate of Incorporation, shares of Class C Capital Stock have the same rights and privileges and rank equally, share ratably and are identical in all respects to the shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock as to all matters. In the event of any merger, consolidation, or other business combination requiring the approval of our stockholders entitled to vote thereon (whether or not we are the surviving entity), the holders of shares of Class C Capital Stock shall receive the same amount and form of consideration on a per share basis as the consideration, if any, received by holders of shares of Class A Common Stock in connection with such merger, consolidation or combination (and if holders of shares of Class A Common Stock are entitled to make an election as to the amount or form of consideration that such holders shall receive in any such merger, consolidation or combination with respect to their shares of Class A Common Stock, then the holders of shares of Class C Capital Stock shall be entitled to make the same election as to their shares of Class C Capital Stock). In the event of any (1) tender or exchange offer to acquire any shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock by any third party pursuant to an agreement to which we are a party, or (2) any tender or exchange offer by us to acquire any shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, the holders of shares of Class C Capital Stock shall receive the same amount and form of consideration on a per share basis as the consideration received by holders of shares of Class A Common Stock (and if holders of shares of Class A Common Stock are entitled to make an election as to the amount or form of consideration that such holders shall receive in any such tender or exchange offer with respect to their shares of Class A Common Stock, then the holders of shares of Class C Capital Stock shall be entitled to make the same election as to their shares of Class C Capital Stock).\n\nClass C Settlement Agreement\n\nIn connection with the adjustment of Google's capital structure by establishing the Google Class C Capital Stock, and the dividend of one share of Google Class C Capital Stock for each share of Google Class A Common Stock and Google Class B Common Stock outstanding on March 27, 2014 (the 'Class C dividend'), on October 28, 2013, the Delaware Court of Chancery approved a settlement entered into by Google, the Board of Directors of Google and the plaintiffs in the class action litigation involving the authorization to distribute Google Class C Capital Stock captioned In Re: Google Inc. Class C Shareholder Litigation, Civil Action No. 7469-CS. The parties subsequently filed a Revised Stipulation of Compromise and Settlement with the Court, which issued an Order and Final Judgment on November 6, 2013 that fully approved the parties' settlement agreement (the 'Google Class C Settlement'). Additionally, on October 2, 2015, we entered into a Class C Undertaking pertaining to the Google Class C Settlement, pursuant to which Alphabet will undertake, with respect to the Alphabet securities, to be bound by the restrictions, undertakings and all continuing obligations and to benefit from the rights of the Google Class C Settlement Agreement that are applicable to Google as if Alphabet were Google (the 'Class C Undertaking').\n\nThe terms of the Class C Undertaking require us to: (i) ensure that the Transfer Restriction Agreements (defined below) entered into by Larry, our Co-Founder and director; Sergey, our Co-Founder and director; and Eric E. Schmidt, our significant stockholder; and certain of their respective affiliates cannot be waived or amended unless such amendment or waiver is first considered and recommended by a committee of two or more of the independent directors of our Board of Directors who do not hold Class B Common Stock, and then approved by every member of our Board of Directors, excluding Larry and Sergey; (ii) ensure that any waiver or amendment of the Transfer Restriction Agreements will be publicly disclosed at least 30 days before such waiver or amendment takes effect on a Form 8-K, Form 10-Q or Form 10-K; (iii) effective for three years from the Class C dividend payment date, prior to issuing more than 10 million shares of Class C Capital Stock as consideration in an acquisition or other business combination (excluding assumptions or conversions of equity for employees of acquired or combined companies), have our independent directors consider the effects of issuing such shares on our holders of Class A Common Stock and upon the company as a whole; and (iv) when the aggregate voting power of Larry and Sergey falls below 15% of the cumulative voting power of all our shareholders, have our Board of Directors consider in good faith whether it is no longer in our best interests to maintain a class of nonvoting stock and, if it so determines, take steps to cause the Class C Capital Stock to convert into Class A Common Stock.\n\nTransfer Restriction Agreements\n\nOn October 2, 2015, we entered into a transfer restriction agreement with each of Larry, Sergey, Eric and certain of their respective affiliates (collectively, the 'Transfer Restriction Agreements'). On December 31, 2021, we entered into a joinder to Sergey's transfer restriction agreement with certain of his other affiliates. The Transfer Restriction Agreements are intended to limit the ability of Larry, Sergey, and Eric to sell their Alphabet stock in a manner that does not reduce their voting power. Under the Transfer Restriction Agreements, the parties are bound, without any modification, by the same restrictions, undertakings and obligations that are imposed under the transfer restriction agreements, related joinders and other documentation entered into with Google on March 25, 2014 in connection with the Google Class C Settlement (the 'Google Transfer Restriction Agreements').\n\nPursuant to the Transfer Restriction Agreements, none of Larry, Sergey, Eric, or certain of their respective affiliates that are party to the agreements (generally, trusts and other estate planning vehicles through which Larry, Sergey, and Eric hold all or a portion of their shares of Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock or Class C Capital Stock) may sell, assign, transfer, convey or hypothecate any shares of Class C Capital Stock if, as a result of such sale, transfer, conveyance or hypothecation, they, together with certain of their respective affiliates, would own more shares of Class B Common Stock than shares of Class C Capital Stock. If at any time either Larry, Sergey, or Eric, in each case together with certain of his respective affiliates, owns more shares of Class B Common Stock than shares of Class C Capital Stock, then Larry, Sergey, or Eric, as the case may be, and his respective affiliates, will be deemed to have automatically converted that number of shares of Class B Common Stock into shares of Class A Common Stock such that after such conversion he and his affiliates own an equal number of shares of Class B Common Stock as he and his affiliates own of shares of Class C Capital Stock. The required maximum ratio of shares of Class B Common Stock to shares of Class C Capital Stock owned by Larry, Sergey and Eric is subject to adjustment in connection with certain dividends, stock splits, distributions or recapitalizations. Larry, Sergey, Eric, and certain of their respective affiliates that are party to the Transfer Restriction Agreements may transfer shares of Class B Common Stock to their affiliates as permitted by the terms of our Certificate of Incorporation only if, immediately following such transfer, Larry, Sergey, or Eric, as the case may be, and his respective affiliates, would own an aggregate number of shares of Class B Common Stock equal to or less than the number of shares of Class C Capital Stock that he and his affiliates own. Additionally, Larry, Sergey, Eric, and certain of their respective affiliates that are party to the Transfer Restriction Agreements may transfer shares of Class C Capital Stock to their affiliates only if, immediately following such transfer, Larry, Sergey, or Eric, as the case may be, and his respective affiliates, would own an aggregate number of shares of Class B Common Stock equal to or less than the number of shares of Class C Capital Stock that he and his affiliates own. However, each of Larry and his affiliates that are party to his Transfer Restriction Agreement and Sergey and his affiliates that are party to his Transfer Restriction Agreement may not transfer shares of Class B Common Stock to another person in a transfer that does not result in the automatic conversion of such shares of Class B Common Stock into Class A Common Stock pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of Incorporation unless Larry or Sergey, as the case may be, and his respective affiliates, transfer, in the same manner and to the same extent, an equal number of shares of Class C Capital Stock to the transferee.\n\nIn the event of (1) any merger, consolidation, or other business combination requiring the approval of the holders of our capital stock (whether or not Alphabet is the surviving entity), or the acquisition of all or substantially all of our assets, (2) any tender or exchange offer by any third party to acquire a majority of the shares of Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock or Class C Capital Stock, or (3) any tender or exchange offer by us to acquire any shares of Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock, or Class C Capital Stock, none of Larry, Sergey, Eric, and certain of their respective affiliates that are party to the Transfer Restriction Agreements may sell, transfer or exchange, directly or indirectly, any shares of Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock, or Class C Capital Stock in connection with such transaction or in a related transaction for (a) with respect to their shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, an amount per share greater than the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock receive in such transaction or a form of consideration different from the form that the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock would receive, or may elect to receive, in such transaction; or (b) with respect to their shares of Class C Capital Stock, an amount per share greater than the holders of shares of Class C Capital Stock receive in such transaction or a form of consideration different from the form that the holders of shares of Class C Capital Stock\n\nwould receive, or may elect to receive, in such transaction (the 'Founder Equal Treatment Provision'). With respect to Larry, Sergey, and certain of their respective affiliates, the applicable Transfer Restriction Agreements generally terminate when they collectively hold less than 34% of our total outstanding voting power. However, the Founder Equal Treatment Provision never terminates. With respect to Eric and certain of his affiliates, the applicable Transfer Restriction Agreement generally terminates when they collectively hold less than 2% of our total outstanding voting power. However, the Founder Equal Treatment Provision never terminates.\n\nAs required under the terms of the Class C Settlement Agreement, the Transfer Restriction Agreements may only be amended or waived if such amendment or waiver is (i) first considered and recommended by a committee of two or more independent directors of our Board of Directors who do not hold Class B Common Stock and (ii) then approved by every member of our Board of Directors, excluding Larry and Sergey. Any Transfer Restriction Agreement amendment or waiver will be publicly disclosed by Alphabet on a Form 8-K, Form 10-Q or Form 10-K at least 30 days before such amendment or waiver takes effect.\n\nPreferred Stock\n\nWe are authorized to issue, without approval by our stockholders, up to a total of 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. Our Board of Directors may establish the number of shares to be included in each such series and may fix the designations, preferences, powers, and other rights, and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions of the shares of a series of preferred stock. Our Board of Directors could authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could dilute the voting power or rights of the holders of Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could, among other things, have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Alphabet and might harm the market price of our Class A Common Stock or Class C Capital Stock.\n\nThe particular terms of any series of preferred stock offered by us may include:\n\nthe number of shares of the preferred stock being offered;\n\nthe title and liquidation preference per share of the preferred stock;\n\nthe purchase price of the preferred stock;\n\nthe dividend rate or method for determining the dividend rate;\n\nthe dates on which dividends will be paid;\n\nwhether dividends on the preferred stock will be cumulative or noncumulative and, if cumulative, the dates from which dividends shall commence to accumulate;\n\nany redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the preferred stock;\n\nany securities exchange on which the preferred stock may be listed; and\n\nany additional dividend, liquidation, redemption, sinking fund and other rights and restrictions applicable to the preferred stock.\n\nHolders of preferred stock will be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors, cash dividends at the rates and on the dates established by such series of preferred stock. Dividend rates may be fixed or variable or both. Different series of preferred stock may be entitled to dividends at different dividend rates or based upon different methods of determination. Each dividend will be payable to the holders of record as they appear on our stock books on record dates determined by our Board of Directors. Dividends on preferred stock may be cumulative or noncumulative. If our Board of Directors fails to declare a dividend on any preferred stock for which dividends are noncumulative, then the right to receive that dividend will be lost, and we will have no obligation to pay the dividend for that dividend period, whether or not dividends are declared for any future dividend period.\n\nAny series of preferred stock may be redeemable in whole or in part at our option. In addition, any series of preferred stock may be subject to mandatory redemption pursuant to a sinking fund.\n\nAnti-Takeover Effects of Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and of Delaware Law\n\nCertain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and of the DGCL could have the effect of delaying, deferring, or discouraging another party from acquiring control of us. In particular, our capital structure concentrates ownership of our voting stock in the hands of Larry, Sergey, and Eric. These provisions, which are summarized below, are expected to discourage coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. These provisions are also designed to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to first negotiate with our Board of Directors. However, these provisions could also have the effect of discouraging others from attempting hostile takeovers and, as a consequence, they may also inhibit temporary fluctuations in the market price of our Class A Common Stock or Class C Capital Stock that often result from actual or rumored hostile takeover attempts. These provisions may also have the effect of preventing changes in our management. It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish transactions that stockholders may otherwise deem to be in their best interests.\n\nThree Classes of Stock\n\nAs discussed above, our Class B Common Stock has 10 votes per share, while our Class A Common Stock has one vote per share and our Class C Capital Stock has no voting rights (unless otherwise required by law). As a result of their ownership of a substantial portion of our Class B Common Stock, Larry and Sergey currently have the ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted for a vote of our stockholders. This concentrated voting control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover, or other change of control transaction that other stockholders may view as beneficial. Because the Class C Capital Stock has no voting rights (except as required by law), the issuance of Class C Capital Stock will not result in voting dilution to the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock. As a result, the issuance of Class C Capital Stock could prolong the duration of Larry and Sergey's current relative ownership of our voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. So long as Larry and Sergey have the ability to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, third parties may be deterred in their willingness to make an unsolicited merger, takeover, or other change of control proposal, or to engage in a proxy contest for the election of directors. As a result, our three classes of stock may have the effect of depriving our stockholders of an opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices and make it more difficult to replace our directors and management.\n\nSpecial Approval for Change in Control Transactions\n\nIn the event a person seeks to acquire us by means of a merger or consolidation transaction, a purchase of all or substantially all of our assets, or an issuance of our voting securities representing more than 2% of our outstanding shares at the time of issuance and that results in any person or group owning more than 50% of our outstanding voting power, then these types of acquisition transactions must be approved by our stockholders at an annual or special meeting. At this meeting, we must obtain the approval of stockholders representing the greater of:\n\na majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock; and\n\n60% of the voting power of the shares of capital stock present in person or represented by proxy at the stockholder meeting and entitled to vote.\n\nLimits on Ability of Stockholders to Act by Written Consent\n\nWe have provided in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws that our stockholders may not act by written consent. This limit on the ability of our stockholders to act by written consent may lengthen the amount of time required to take stockholder actions. As a result, no stockholder, regardless of how large its holdings of our stock are, would be able to amend our Bylaws or remove directors without holding a stockholders meeting.\n\nUndesignated Preferred Stock\n\nThe ability to authorize undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us. These and other provisions may have the effect of deferring or preventing hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our company.\n\nRequirements for Advance Notification of Stockholder Nominations and Proposals\n\nOur Bylaws establish advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals and the nomination of candidates for election as directors, other than nominations made by or at the direction of our Board of Directors or a committee of our Board of Directors. The Bylaws do not give our Board of Directors the power to approve or disapprove stockholder nominations of candidates or proposals regarding business to be conducted at a special or annual meeting of the stockholders. However, our Bylaws may have the effect of precluding the conduct of certain business at a meeting if the proper procedures are not followed. These provisions may also discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer's own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.\n\nDelaware Anti-Takeover Statute\n\nWe are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL regulating corporate takeovers. In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging, under certain circumstances, in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date the person became an interested stockholder unless:\n\nprior to the date of the transaction, the Board of Directors of the corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;\n\nupon completion of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the number of shares outstanding (1) shares owned by persons who are directors and also officers and (2) shares owned by employee stock plans in which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or\n\non or subsequent to the date of the transaction, the business combination is approved by the Board of Directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested stockholder.\n\nGenerally, a business combination includes a merger, asset or stock sale, or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. An interested stockholder is a person who owns 15% or more of a corporation's outstanding voting securities, or is an affiliate or associate of the corporation and within three years prior to the determination of interested stockholder status did own 15% or more of a corporation's outstanding voting securities, and affiliates and associates of such person. The existence of this provision may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions our Board of Directors does not approve in advance. Section 203 may also discourage attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of capital stock held by stockholders.\n\nListing\n\nOur Class C Capital Stock and Class A Common Stock are listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbols 'GOOG' and 'GOOGL' respectively. Our Class B Common Stock is not listed on any stock market or exchange.\n\nExhibit 10.08.3\n\nALPHABET INC. AMENDED AND RESTATED 2021 STOCK PLAN ALPHABET PERFORMANCE STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT\n\nThis  Alphabet  Performance  Stock  Unit  Agreement  (this  ' Agreement ')  is  entered  into  as  of  the Grant  Date  (as  defined  below)  by  and  between  the  Participant  (as  defined  below)  and  Alphabet  Inc.,  a Delaware corporation (' Alphabet ', and together with its Subsidiaries, the ' Company '). Capitalized terms used  but  not  otherwise  defined  in  this  Agreement  shall  have  the  meanings  given  to  such  terms  in  the Alphabet Inc. Amended and Restated 2021 Stock Plan (the ' Plan ').\n\nI. GRANTS\n\nPursuant to the Plan, Alphabet hereby awards grants of performance stock units (' PSUs ,' and each grant of PSUs, a ' Grant '). Certain details of the PSUs, specifically the name of the individual being granted PSUs under this Agreement (the ' Participant '), the date on which the PSUs subject to this Agreement are granted  (the  ' Grant Date '),  the  number  of  PSUs  granted  (the  ' Target Award ')  and  the  Performance Period during which the PSUs are earned (collectively, the ' PSU Details ') are accessible to the Participant through  the  Participant's  brokerage  account  and  the  PSU  Details  are  hereby  incorporated  into  this Agreement by reference. Each PSU represents the right to receive one share of Capital Stock, subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement. The number of PSUs earned under each Grant may be equal to, greater than or less than its Target Award (including zero).\n\nII. TERMS OF PSUs\n\n1. Vesting of PSUs.\n\n(a) In General. Except as otherwise provided in subsections (b) and (c) below, the number of PSUs (if any) earned by the Participant under each Grant based on Alphabet's performance against the Performance Goals (as defined in Exhibit A) during the applicable Performance Period as determined by the Committee in accordance with Exhibit A (each, a ' Final Award ') will vest on the Determination Date (as defined in Exhibit A) for such Grant, subject to the Participant's continued employment with, or service to, the Company through such date, and be settled in accordance with Section II.2 below, and any unvested PSUs will be forfeited as of the Determination Date and the Participant will have no further rights to such unvested PSUs. In the event the Participant ceases to be employed by, or ceases to provide services to, the Company prior to the Determination Date for a Grant for any reason other than (i) death (as set forth in subsection (b) below) or (ii) termination by the Company without Cause (as set forth in subsection (c) below), all of the then outstanding and unvested PSUs granted under this Agreement will be forfeited effective as of the date that the Participant  ceases  to  be  employed  by,  or  ceases  to  provide  services  to,  the  Company  (the  ' Termination Date ') and the Participant will have no further rights to such unvested PSUs. Prior to any actual delivery of shares of Capital Stock pursuant to the PSUs, the PSUs represent an unfunded, unsecured obligation of the Company, payable (if at all) only from the general assets of the Company.\n\n(b) Death of the Participant. In the event that the Participant ceases to be employed by, or ceases to provide services to, the Company as a result of the Participant's death (i)(x) prior to the start of the Performance Period of a Grant or during the Performance Period of a Grant, then the Target Award in respect of such Grant shall immediately vest as of the Termination Date or (y) following the end of the Performance Period of a Grant but prior to its Determination Date, then the Final Award (as determined by the Committee in accordance with Exhibit A) in respect of such Grant shall immediately vest as of such Determination Date and (ii) any delivery of shares of Capital Stock to be made to the Participant under this Agreement will be made, subject to satisfaction of all applicable Tax-Related Items, as described in Section II.4 below, to the Participant's  designated  beneficiary;  provided,  that,  such  beneficiary  has  been  designated  prior  to  the Participant's  death;  in  the  absence  of  any  such  effective  designation,  the  shares  will  be  delivered  to  the administrator  or  executor  of  the  Participant's  estate.  Any  such  administrator  or  executor  must  furnish Alphabet with (A) written notice of his or her status as transferee, (B) a copy of the will and/or such evidence as the Committee may deem necessary to establish the validity of the transfer, and (C) an agreement by the transferee  to  comply  with  all  the  terms  and  conditions  of  PSUs  that  are  or  would  be  applicable  to  the Participant  and  to  be  bound  by  the  acknowledgments  made  by  the  Participant  hereunder.  Delivery  of  the shares of Capital Stock in respect of PSUs vesting pursuant to this Section II.1(b) will be made as soon as practicable following the Termination Date or the Determination Date, as applicable, but in no event later than forty five (45) days following such date and the Company shall have no further obligations under this Agreement.\n\n(c) Termination of the Participant without Cause. In the event that the Participant ceases to be employed by, or ceases to provide services to, the Company as a result of the Company's termination of the Participant's employment or services without Cause prior to the Determination Date for a Grant, then the number of PSUs (if  any)  calculated  by  multiplying  the  Final  Award  (as  determined  by  the  Committee  in accordance with Exhibit A) in respect of such Grant by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days during the Performance Period during which the Participant was employed by, or providing services  to,  the  Company  and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  aggregate  number  of  calendar  days  in  the Performance Period, will vest and be settled in accordance with Section II.2 below and any unvested PSUs will be forfeited as of the Determination Date and the Participant will have no further rights to such unvested PSUs; provided, that if the Termination Date occurs prior to the start of the Performance Period of a Grant, all PSUs under the Grant will be immediately forfeited as of the Termination Date and the Participant will have no further rights to such PSUs.\n\nFor purposes of this Agreement, ' Cause ' means any of the following: (i) a willful failure by Participant,  in  the  good  faith  judgment  of  the  Board,  to  substantially  perform  the  duties  associated  and consistent with the scope of the Participant's position; (ii) the Participant's refusal to implement or follow a lawful  directive  from  the  Board;  (iii)  the  Participant's  breach  of  fiduciary  duty  to  the  Company;  (iv)  the Participant's material breach of any written agreement between the Participant and the Company, including, without limitation, any applicable At-Will Employment, Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement;  (v)  the  Participant's  intentional  engagement  in  conduct  that  is  materially  injurious  to  the Company (economically or reputationally), including but not limited to, misappropriation of trade secrets or any other tangible or intangible property of the Company, fraud or embezzlement, but excluding any conduct by  Participant  that  is  consistent  with  or  pursuant  to  a  lawful  directive  of  the  Board;  (vi)  the  Participant's material violation of a material provision of the Code of Conduct or any policy of Alphabet, Google LLC or any other affiliate of Alphabet that is applicable to the Participant (e.g., policy against sexual harassment, Alphabet's  Policy  Against  Insider  Trading  (the  \" Trading  Policy \"),  etc.);  (vii)  the  Participant's  material violation  of  any  federal  or  state  law  or  regulation  applicable  to  the  business  of  the  Company;  (viii)  the Participant's  violation  of  any  securities  laws,  rules  or  regulations,  or  the  rules  and  regulations  of  any securities exchange or association of which the Company is a member, failure to cooperate with the Company in any\n\n2\n\ninvestigation  or  formal  proceeding  or  being  found  liable  in  a  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission enforcement  action  or  otherwise  being  disqualified  from  serving  in  the  Participant's  position;  (ix)  the Participant's engaging in gross misconduct; or (x) the Participant's commission of a felony under the laws of the  United  States  or  any  state  thereof  or  any  comparably-classified  crime  under  the  laws  of  a  non-US jurisdiction or other serious crime involving moral turpitude. Notwithstanding the foregoing, termination of the Participant's employment or service under (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (vi) (only) above will not be for 'Cause' unless the Participant: (a) is provided with written notice setting forth with specificity the conduct alleged to constitute 'Cause,' (b) is provided not less than 30 days following such notice (the ' Cure Period ') to cure or remedy  such  conduct  (to  the  extent  susceptible  of  cure  or  remedy)  prior  to  the  effective  date  of  the Participant's termination of employment or services, during which period the Participant shall be provided the opportunity at the Participant's election to address the Board with respect to such conduct (with the assistance of legal counsel, if requested) and (c) fails to cure or remedy such conduct during the Cure Period.\n\nSettlement of PSUs. Settlement of vested PSUs in respect of a Grant shall occur as soon as practicable  following  the  applicable  Determination  Date,  but  in  no  event  later  than  forty  five  (45)  days following such Determination Date, and the Company shall have no further obligations under such Grant. Alphabet will settle vested PSUs by issuing (either in book-entry form or otherwise) to the Participant (or the Participant's beneficiary or estate, in the event of the Participant's death), one share of Capital Stock for each vested PSU, subject to satisfaction of all applicable Tax-Related Items, as described in Section II.4 below.\n\nAdjustment Upon Certain Changes. In the event of any transaction or other event described in Section 9 of the Plan, each Grant shall be treated the same way as all other performance stock units issued under the Plan held by the executive officers of Alphabet in office at the time of such event; provided, that in addition to any actions taken by the Committee in respect of such awards pursuant to Sections 9(c) and (d) of the Plan, to the extent determined by the Committee to be necessary and appropriate in its sole discretion, the number of PSUs subject to each Grant will be fixed at its Target Award.\n\n4. Taxes.\n\n(a) Liability  for  Tax-Related  Items.  The  Participant  acknowledges that the Participant is ultimately  liable  and  responsible  for  any  and  all  income  taxes  (including  federal,  state  and  local  income taxes), payroll taxes and other tax-related withholding (the ' Tax-Related Items ') arising in connection with PSUs, regardless of any action the Company takes with respect to such Tax-Related Items. The Participant further acknowledges that the Company (i) does not make any representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of PSUs, including the grant, vesting and settlement  of  PSUs  under  any  Grant,  or  the  subsequent  sale  of  shares  of  Capital  Stock  acquired  upon settlement of any PSUs and (ii) does not commit, and is under no obligation, to structure the terms of PSUs or any aspect of PSUs under any Grant to reduce or eliminate the Participant's liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result.\n\n(b) Payment  of  Withholding  Taxes.  Alphabet  shall,  pursuant  to  such  procedures  as  the Committee may specify from time to time, withhold a number of shares of Capital Stock otherwise issuable upon settlement of any vested PSUs having an aggregate Fair Market Value sufficient to satisfy the federal, state and local withholding tax requirements attributable to vested PSUs but not greater than the withholding obligations, as determined by the Committee in its discretion; provided, that, the Committee hereby reserves the discretion to amend this Agreement by notice to the Participant and without obtaining the Participant's consent, to allow the Committee to use any one or more methods permitted by the Plan to satisfy the federal, state and local withholding tax requirements attributable to the PSUs being settled.\n\n3\n\nRights as Stockholder. Neither the Participant nor any person claiming under or through the Participant will have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of Alphabet in respect of any shares of Capital Stock deliverable pursuant to PSUs unless and until such shares of Capital Stock have been issued on the records of Alphabet or its transfer agents or registrars. After such issuance, the Participant will have all the rights as a stockholder of Alphabet with respect to such shares of Capital Stock.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any dividend or other distribution is declared and paid on shares of Capital Stock after the Grant Date (the date of such dividend or other distribution, the ' Dividend Payment Date '),  dividend equivalents in the form of additional PSUs shall be credited to the Participant. The number of additional PSUs to be credited as dividend equivalents to such Participant shall be determined (x) to the extent the dividend or other distribution is in the form of cash, by dividing (A) the product of (i) the total number of outstanding and unsettled Target Award PSUs held by the Participant immediately prior to the Dividend Payment Date, and (ii) the per-share amount of the dividend paid on shares of Capital Stock on the Dividend Payment Date, by (B) the Fair Market value of a share of Capital Stock on the Dividend Payment Date and (y) to the extent the dividend is in the form of Capital Stock, by multiplying (x) the total number of outstanding  and  unsettled  Target  Award  PSUs  held  by  the  Participant  immediately  prior  to  the  Dividend Payment Date and (y) the number of shares of Capital Stock paid as a dividend per share of Capital Stock. Any additional PSUs credited to the Participant under this Section 5 as dividend equivalents shall be subject to  the  restrictions  and  conditions  that  apply  to  the  PSUs  with  respect  to  which  such  additional  PSUs  are credited  and  will  be  earned  and  payable  if  and  when  the  underlying  PSU  becomes  earned  and  payable, including taking into account the percentage of Target Award earned per Exhibit A. If the underlying PSU does not vest or is otherwise forfeited, any additional PSUs credited under this Section 5 with respect to the underlying PSU will also fail to vest and be forfeited. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Committee may specify an alternative form of dividend equivalents from that specified herein with respect to any such dividend or other distribution.\n\nNo  Special  Employment  Rights;  No  Right  to  Future  Awards.  Nothing  contained  in  this Agreement shall confer upon the Participant any right with respect to the continuation of the Participant's employment by, or service to, the Company or interfere in any way with the right of the Company at any time to terminate such employment or service or to increase or decrease the compensation of the Participant from the rate in existence at the Grant Date. The award of the Grants is at the sole discretion of Alphabet and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of PSUs, or benefits in lieu of PSUs, even if PSUs have been awarded to the Participant repeatedly in the past.\n\nPSUs Not Transferable. Except to the limited extent provided in Section II.1(b) above, PSUs and the rights and privileges conferred under the Grants awarded hereby may not be transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated in any way by the Participant (whether by operation of law or otherwise) and may not  be  subject  to  sale  under  execution,  attachment  or  similar  process.  Any  attempt  by  the  Participant  to transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise transfer PSUs, or any right or privilege conferred under the Grants awarded hereby, and any attempted sale under any execution, attachment or similar process, shall be void and unenforceable against the Company.\n\nNotwithstanding the immediately preceding paragraph, and subject to the terms and conditions of this paragraph, the Participant may, with the Company's express written consent, transfer all or a portion of any unvested Grants (but only a whole number of PSUs subject to any Grant) into one or more trusts for the purposes of estate planning (the \" Trust \"). Any Trust must: (a) be subject to any and all terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement, including, but not limited to, Section II.1 of this Agreement; (b) be described in\n\n4\n\nGeneral Instruction A.1(a)(5) of Form S-8; (c) not provide Participant with any consideration in connection with a transfer permitted under this paragraph; and (d) if requested by the Company, comply with the Trading Policy (as it may be amended from time to time). The Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Company has  not  made,  and  does  not  make  in  connection  with  the  Grants  made  under  this  Agreement,  any representations  under  any  applicable  law,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  federal  or  state  tax,  securities, property, probate or other estate laws, and that the Participant is solely responsible for compliance with all such  applicable  laws,  with  respect  to  any  Grants  or  PSUs  transferred  into  a  Trust  as  permitted  under  this paragraph.\n\nModification; Entire Agreement; Waiver. No modification of any provision of this Agreement which reduces the Participant's rights hereunder will be valid unless the same is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. This Agreement, including Exhibit A, together with the Plan, represent the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the PSUs awarded by the Grants hereunder. The failure of Alphabet to enforce  at  any  time  any  provision  of  this  Agreement  will  in  no  way  be  construed  to  be  a  waiver  of  such provision  or  of  any  other  provision  hereof.  Alphabet  reserves  the  right,  however,  to  the  extent  Alphabet deems necessary or advisable in its sole discretion, to unilaterally alter or modify the terms of the Grants awarded under this Agreement in order to ensure that PSUs either qualify for exemption from, or comply with,  the  requirements  of  Section  409A  of  the  Internal  Revenue  Code  of  1986,  as  amended,  and  the regulations  promulgated  thereunder  (' Section  409A ');  provided,  however  that  the  Company  makes  no representations that PSUs will be exempt from, or will comply with, the requirements of Section 409A.\n\nBinding Agreement. Subject to the limitation on the transferability of PSUs contained herein, this  Agreement  will  be  binding  upon  and  inure  to  the  benefit  of  the  heirs,  legatees,  legal  representatives, successors and assigns of the parties hereto.\n\nAdditional Conditions to Issuance of Shares of Capital Stock. Alphabet shall not be required to issue any shares of Capital Stock hereunder prior to fulfillment of all of the following conditions: (a) the completion of any registration or other qualification of such shares of Capital Stock under any federal or state law  or  under  the  rulings  or  regulations  of  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  or  any  other governmental regulatory body, or under any stock exchange on which the shares of Capital Stock are listed for  trading,  which  the  Committee  shall,  in  its  absolute  discretion,  deem  necessary  or  advisable;  (b)  the obtaining  of  any  approval  or  other  clearance  from  any  federal  or  state  governmental  agency,  which  the Committee shall, in its absolute discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable; and (c) the lapse of such reasonable  period  of  time  not  to  exceed  forty-five  (45)  days  following  a  Determination  Date  as  the Committee may establish from time to time for reasons of administrative convenience.\n\nPlan Governs. This Agreement is subject in all respects to all terms and provisions of the Plan and the Plan document is hereby incorporated into this Agreement. In the event of a conflict between one or more provisions of this Agreement and one or more provisions of the Plan, the provisions of the Plan will control.\n\n12. Policy Against Insider Trading; Recoupment.\n\n(a) By accepting the Grants, the Participant acknowledges that (i) a copy of the Trading Policy has been made available to the Participant, (ii) the Participant has had an opportunity to review the Trading Policy and (iii) the Participant is bound by all the terms and conditions of the Trading Policy.\n\n(b) By accepting the Grants, the Participant agrees that (i) incentive-based compensation paid to the Participant pursuant to this Agreement may be subject to recoupment or clawback to the extent permitted or required by applicable law (A) in the event of a\n\n5\n\nrestatement of financial statements due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement as a result of misconduct by any person or (B) as may be required by any applicable listing standards of a national securities exchange adopted in accordance with Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and  Consumer  Protection  Act  and  any  implementing  rules  and  regulations  of  the  U.S.  Securities  and Exchange Commission adopted thereunder, and (ii) by accepting the Grants pursuant to the Plan and this Agreement,  Participant  authorizes  such  clawback  and  agrees  to  comply  with  any  Company  request  or demand for such recoupment.\n\nCommittee Authority. The Committee has full discretionary authority to administer the Plan, including  discretionary  authority  to  interpret  and  construe  any  and  all  provisions  of  the  Plan  and  this Agreement and to adopt and amend from time to time such rules and regulations for the administration of the Plan  as  the  Committee  may  deem  necessary  or  appropriate.  All  actions  taken  and  all  interpretations  and determinations made by the Committee will be final and binding upon the Participant, the Company and all other interested persons.\n\nCaptions. Captions provided herein are for convenience only and shall not affect the scope, meaning, intent or interpretation of the provisions of this Agreement.\n\nSeverability.  In  the  event  that  any  provision  in  this  Agreement  is  held  to  be  invalid  or unenforceable for any reason, such provision will be severable from, and such invalidity or unenforceability will not be construed to have any effect on, the remaining provisions of this Agreement.\n\nGoverning Law. This Agreement shall be construed and administered in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law principles.\n\nSection 409A Compliance. It is intended that the Plan and the Agreement comply with, or be exempt from, the requirements of Section 409A and any related guidance promulgated with respect to such Section  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  the  Treasury  or  the  Internal  Revenue  Service.  Accordingly,  to  the maximum  extent  permitted,  this  Agreement  shall  be  interpreted  and  administered  to  be  in  compliance therewith  or  exempt  therefrom.  Notwithstanding  anything  contained  herein  to  the  contrary,  to  the  extent required in order to avoid accelerated taxation and/or tax penalties under Section 409A, the Participant shall not  be  considered  to  have  terminated  employment  with,  or  service  to,  the  Company  for  purposes  of  this Agreement until the Participant would be considered to have incurred a 'separation from service' from the Company within the meaning of Section 409A. Each amount to be paid or benefit to be provided pursuant to this Agreement shall be construed as a separate identified payment for purposes of Section 409A.\n\n18. Employee Data Privacy.\n\n(a) The  Participant  hereby  explicitly  and  unambiguously  consents  to  the  collection,  use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of the Participant's personal data as described in this Agreement by and  among,  as  applicable,  the  Company  and  its  Subsidiaries  and  affiliates  for  the  exclusive  purpose  of implementing, administering and managing the Participant's participation in the Plan.\n\n(b) The Participant understands that the Company may hold certain personal information about him, including, but not limited to, the Participant's name, home address and telephone number, date of birth,  social  insurance  number  or  other  identification  number,  salary,  nationality,  job  title,  any  shares  of Capital  Stock  or  directorships  held  in  the  Company,  details  of  all  entitlement  to  shares  of  Capital  Stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or\n\n6\n\noutstanding  in  Participant's  favor,  for  the  purpose  of  implementing,  administering  and  managing  the  Plan (' Data ').\n\n(c) The Participant  understands  that  Data  will  be  transferred  to  Charles  Schwab  &  Co., Inc., Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC, and/or such other third parties as may be selected by the Company in the future to assist the Company with the implementation, administration and management of the Plan, that these recipients may be located in the Participant's country or elsewhere, and that the recipient's country may have different data privacy laws and protections than the Participant's country. The Participant understands that  he  or  she  may  request  a  list  with  the  names  and  addresses  of  any  potential  recipients  of  the  Data  by contacting the Participant's local human resources representative.\n\n(d) The Participant authorizes the Company, Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC, and any other possible recipients which may assist the Company (presently or in the future) with implementing, administering and managing the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the sole purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Participant's participation in the Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data as may be required to a broker  or  other  third  party  with  whom  the  Participant  may  elect  to  deposit  any  shares  of  Capital  Stock acquired upon settlement of the PSUs. The Participant understands that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage the Participant's participation in the Plan.

The Participant must accept the Grants and agree to the terms and conditions of the Grants as set forth in the Plan and this Agreement (including Exhibit A), by electronically accepting this Agreement immediately following the Grant Date.\n\n7\n\nEXHIBIT A\n\nA. Performance Goals. The number of PSUs that may be earned under each Grant will be determined based on Alphabet's achievement of Threshold, Target or Maximum levels (' Performance Goals ')  of  cumulative  total  shareholder  return  (' TSR ')  vs.  the  respective  TSRs  of  the  constituent companies in the S&P 100 Index (the ' S&P 100 Index Companies ') (the ' TSR Performance ') over the Performance Period in respect of such Grant. The terms ' Threshold ,' ' Target ' and ' Maximum ,' when used in this Exhibit A to describe Alphabet's TSR Performance, are defined below:\n\nTSR Performance for Alphabet and for the S&P 100 Index Companies (each, a ' Peer Company ') shall be calculated as follows:\n\n(Ending Average Share Price - Starting Average Share Price) + Dividends Reinvested Starting Average Share Price\n\nWhere:\n\nStarting Average Share Price for both Alphabet and the Peer Companies is equal to the average closing price for each trading day in the 90 calendar day period ending on the calendar day immediately preceding the first day of the Performance Period (inclusive of such calendar day).\n\nEnding Average Share Price for both Alphabet and the Peer Companies is equal to the average closing price for each trading day in the 90 calendar day period ending on the last calendar day of the Performance Period (inclusive of such last calendar day).\n\nThe Peer Companies are those companies (other than Alphabet) comprising the S&P 100 Index on the Grant Date adjusted as follows in the event of certain corporate events in connection with the Peer Companies:\n\n8\n\nDividends Reinvested for both Alphabet and the Peer Companies shall mean dividends paid with respect to an ex-dividend date that occurs beginning from the date when the Starting Average Share Price is measured through the end of the Performance Period (whether or not the dividend payment date occurs during this period), which shall be deemed to have been reinvested in the underlying Capital Stock or common shares, as applicable.\n\nFor TSR Performance, should Alphabet fail to achieve at least Threshold, zero percent (0%) of the Target Award shall be earned. Should Alphabet achieve (a) Threshold, fifty percent (50%) of the Target Award shall be earned, (b) Target, one hundred percent (100%) of the Target Award shall be earned, or (c) Maximum  (or  greater),  two  hundred  percent  (200%)  of  the  Target  Award  shall  be  earned.  Should Alphabet achieve a TSR Performance level that falls between Threshold and Target or between Target and Maximum,  the  percentage  of  the  Target  Award  that  shall  be  earned  will  be  based  upon  straight-line interpolation between such Performance Goals, rounded up to the nearest whole share of Capital Stock.\n\nDetermination and Approval of Final Award. Within forty five (45) days following the last day of the Performance Period, the Committee shall determine\n\n9\n\nachievement in respect of the Performance Goals (the date of such determination, the ' Determination Date ')  and  shall  calculate  and  approve  the  Final  Award  in  respect  of  such  Grant.  Any  PSUs  that  are determined not to be earned by the Committee under such Grant will be forfeited as of the Determination Date and the Participant will have no further rights to such PSUs.\n\nThe Committee, in its sole discretion, shall make all determinations regarding the Performance Goals, including, but not limited to, the extent of achievement, and any adjustments to the calculation of TSR  of  Alphabet  or  the  Peer  Companies,  as  necessary  or  appropriate.  Determinations  made  by  the Committee will be final and binding on all parties and will be given the maximum discretion permitted by law.\n\n10\n\nExhibit 10.09\n\nThe Alphabet Inc. Company Bonus Plan was amended for administrative reasons on October 18, 2022 in order to align with the Company's transition to an annual performance management cycle, including a shift in the compensation planning and payout timeline, and to incorporate other administrative updates.\n\n***\n\nALPHABET INC.

The Company does not make any prepayments or advances on bonus.\n\nc.     TIMING OF PAYMENT\n\nThe payment of each Bonus Award with a Performance Period commencing prior to January 1, 2023 shall be made in the two and one half month period immediately following the end of the calendar year in which the applicable Bonus Entitlement Date occurs.

PAYMENT IN THE EVENT OF DEATH OR DISABILITY\n\nSubject to applicable laws, if, on or following the Bonus Entitlement Date but before payment of the Bonus Award, a Participant dies or incurs a Disability, then the Bonus Award shall be paid, in the case of death, to his or her estate or his or her beneficiary pursuant to Section 8(e), and in the case of Disability, to the Participant or any other person authorized under applicable law, in each case at the time that Bonus Awards are otherwise paid pursuant to Section 4(c). If a Participant dies or incurs a Disability before the Bonus Entitlement Date, then his or her estate or his or her beneficiary pursuant to Section 8(e) in the case of death, and the Participant or any other person authorized under applicable law in the case of Disability, will receive a pro rata portion of the Target Award (a ' Prorated Award '), prorated based on the number of days the Participant worked during the Performance Period.

For purposes of clarification and without limiting the foregoing, the Committee or the delegate of the Company in its sole discretion may amend or cancel any outstanding Bonus Awards except to the extent prohibited by applicable law.\n\nb.    TAX WITHHOLDING\n\nThe Company shall withhold all applicable taxes from any Bonus Awards made under the Plan, including any federal, state/provincial and local taxes and mandatory social charges.\n\nc.

Further,  nothing  contained  herein  shall  be  considered  a guarantee  of  employment  for  any  duration  except  to  the  extent  required  by  applicable  law  or  existing contractual obligations.\n\nd . ENTIRE UNDERSTANDING\n\nExcept as expressly set forth herein, this Plan, as it may be modified in accordance with the foregoing, constitutes the entire writing and understanding regarding the subject matter of this Plan and supersedes all prior bonus and incentive plans, whether maintained by Alphabet or any Participating Affiliate, and any written, and/or oral agreement, understanding, or representations, in each case regarding the subject matter of this Plan. All Bonus Awards under this Plan are fully discretionary payments. Participation in this Plan during any Performance Period will not convey any entitlement to participate in this or future plans or to the same or similar bonus benefits, nor does this Plan constitute a guarantee or establish an obligation for the Company to maintain a similar plan or award similar bonus benefits in the future. Bonus Awards under this Plan are a discretionary and extraordinary item of compensation that are outside the normal, regular or expected compensation, and in no way represent any portion of a Participant's salary, compensation, or other remuneration for the purpose of calculating any of the following payments: termination, severance, redundancy, end-of-service premiums, bonuses; long-service awards; overtime premiums; pension or retirement benefits; and any other similar payments and extra benefits; provided that, Bonus Awards are treated as eligible compensation pursuant to, and in accordance with the terms of, the Google LLC 401(k) Savings Plan.\n\ne.    BENEFICIARY DESIGNATIONS\n\nIf permitted by the Committee, a Participant under the Plan may name a beneficiary or beneficiaries to whom any Bonus Award or portion thereof shall be paid in the event of the Participant's death during the applicable Performance Period or following the applicable Performance Period but prior to the applicable payment date pursuant to Section 4(d). Each such designation shall revoke all prior designations by the Participant and shall be effective only if given in a form and manner acceptable to the Committee. In the absence of any such designation, any such Bonus Award shall be paid to the Participant's estate.\n\nf.        SUCCESSORS\n\nAll obligations of the Company with respect to Bonus Awards granted hereunder, shall be binding on any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise.\n\ng.    NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF AWARD\n\nNo  Bonus  Award  may  be  sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated,  other  than  by  will  or  by  the  laws  of  descent  and  distribution  to  the  extent  permitted  by Section 4(d). Any attempt to effect such a prohibited transfer shall be void.\n\nh.    GOVERNING LAW\n\nThe Plan and all Bonus Awards shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the state of California, but without regard to its conflict of law provisions.\n\n9.
